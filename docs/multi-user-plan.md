## Context

Today this system is single-tenant by construction: one D1 database, one
`API_TOKEN` worker secret whose holder can read and write *everything*, one
`private/` folder on one machine holding the daily search prompts, and one set
of `tracks`/`meta` rows that the client renders as *the* page. No row anywhere
carries an owner. The server's own comments say so out loud - "self-hosted,
per-installer deployment... never a shared multi-tenant backend."

We want a second person's job search in the same deployment. Every row needs an
owner, the gate needs to ask who you are, and the per-track search config (role
line, target companies, candidate blurb, geo scope) has to stop being a `.md`
file that exists only on one machine and become D1 config keyed off a user id.
After this change a search is defined entirely by `(user_id, track key)` in the
database; the machine supplies only resumes, mutable per-track notes, and logs.

Decisions made during planning:

- **Identity**: GUID user ids, never the name as a key. Real login - a password
  hashed with PBKDF2, a `sessions` table, and `/api/login` + `/api/logout`, so
  a credential can actually be revoked. No self-signup: users are provisioned
  through an admin-gated route.
- **Config home**: track search config moves into D1 keyed by user id. The
  worker composes the daily prompt and serves it; `run-search.ps1` fetches it
  instead of reading a per-track `.md`. Both people's searches run on one
  machine.

## Phase 1 - Schema: `server/migrations/0002_multi_user.sql`

`0001_schema.sql` says in its own header not to edit it. This is a new
migration with real DDL.

**New tables**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,     -- GUID; the only thing other tables reference
  name          TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- login + display; never a key
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,        -- PBKDF2-SHA256 derived bits, base64 ('' = login disabled)
  password_salt TEXT NOT NULL,
  iterations    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 100000,
  created_at    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);

CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,     -- the bearer token itself (32 random bytes, base64url)
  user_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  label      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''  -- 'browser' | 'scheduled-search' | ...
);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_user ON sessions(user_id);
```

`label` is what makes revocation useful in practice: the headless runner holds
one long-lived session, browsers hold their own, and either can be killed
without touching the other. No expiry - matching today's never-expiring token;
logout is a row delete.

**Backfill user** - insert with a fixed GUID generated when the migration is
written, owning every existing row, with an empty `password_hash` (SQL can't run
PBKDF2). Rollout step 6 sets the real password through the admin route.

**Scope every existing table to a user.** `applications` only needs a column,
so `ALTER TABLE applications ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` +
`UPDATE`. The other five change a PK or UNIQUE constraint, which SQLite cannot
do in place, so each is a create-new / copy / drop / rename rebuild (no foreign
keys are declared anywhere in this schema, so no PRAGMA dance is needed; keep
`id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` and copy ids explicitly so numbering
survives):

| table | change |
|---|---|
| `leads` | `+ user_id`, `UNIQUE(search, url)` → `UNIQUE(user_id, search, url)` - two people can track the same posting independently |
| `screened` | `+ user_id`, same UNIQUE change |
| `tracks` | `+ user_id`, `PRIMARY KEY(key)` → `PRIMARY KEY(user_id, key)` - both can have a track called `SWE` - plus the new config columns below |
| `search_runs` | `+ user_id`, `PRIMARY KEY(track_key)` → `PRIMARY KEY(user_id, track_key)` |
| `meta` | `+ user_id`, `PRIMARY KEY(key)` → `PRIMARY KEY(user_id, key)` - `updated`, `display_title`, `priority_locations` and every other setting become per-person |
| `applications` | `+ user_id` via ALTER |

Add `CREATE INDEX` on `user_id` for `leads`, `applications`, `screened`.

**New `tracks` columns** and **new `meta` setting keys** - see the appendix,
which derives the exact column set from what the live prompts actually contain.

The mutable `docs/tracked_<key>_postings.md` stays a file - it accumulates
fetch-reliability notes the search itself edits each run, which is content, not
config.

> **Superseded.** It is still a document rather than config, for exactly that
> reason - but it no longer lives on the machine that runs the search. It is in
> R2, fetched per run and written back with `If-Match`. What that paragraph got
> right was *why* it is not config; what it did not anticipate was that "a file"
> and "a file on one laptop" are separable. See `private-storage-plan.md`.

## Phase 2 - Server

**`server/src/auth.js`** (new) - all the crypto in one file, no dependencies
(Web Crypto is native to Workers):

- `hashPassword(password, salt?, iterations?)` → `{hash, salt, iterations}` via
  `crypto.subtle.deriveBits` (PBKDF2-SHA256, 100k, 256-bit output).
- `verifyPassword(password, user)` → bool, with a constant-time compare.
- `newSessionToken()` → 32 bytes from `crypto.getRandomValues`, base64url.
- `getSessionUser(d1, token)` → the joined `sessions`/`users` row, or null.

**`server/src/db.js`** - `Db` gains a user: `new Db(env.DB, userId)`, with
`this.userId` used by every statement. Every `SELECT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` gains
`AND user_id = ?`; every `INSERT` writes it; `replaceTracks` and its
`search_runs` sync scope their `DELETE ... NOT IN` to this user. Scoping the
repository rather than passing `userId` per call is the point: no method is
left that *can* forget the filter, and another user's id in `getLead` /
`getApplication` / `trackExists` returns null for free, which the existing
handlers already turn into a 404 with no new code.

User and session access stays outside `Db` (it necessarily runs before a scoped
`Db` exists) - that's `auth.js` plus a small `Users` helper for create /
set-password. Extend `SETTING_KEYS`/`DEFAULT_SETTINGS` with the new settings and
the track row shape with the new config columns.

**`server/src/prompt.js`** (new) - `buildSearchPrompt({user, track, settings,
siblingTracks})` returns the daily prompt text, replacing
`.claude/skills/job-search-setup/templates/scheduled-task.template.md` and the
per-track copies of it in the private folder. See the appendix for the draft and
for what it must carry verbatim. Emitted paths are relative
(`resumes/<file>`, `docs/<doc file>`); the runner sets the working directory.

**`server/src/api.js`** - `authorized(request, env)` goes away. New handlers:

- `handleLogin(request, d1)` - `POST /api/login {name, password, label?}` →
  verify, insert a session, return `{token, user: {id, name}}`. 401 on either
  a bad name or a bad password, with the same message for both.
- `handleLogout(request, d1, token)` - `POST /api/logout` deletes that one
  session row.
- `handleUpsertUser(request, env, d1)` - `POST /api/users {name, password}`,
  gated by a new `ADMIN_TOKEN` worker secret. Creates the user with a fresh
  GUID, or sets the password if the name already exists - so this doubles as
  password reset, which matters because nothing else can hash.
- `handleGetMe(user)` - `GET /api/me` → `{id, name}`.
- `handleGetPrompt(db, user, key)` - `GET /api/prompt/<track key>` →
  `text/plain`, 404 on an unconfigured key.

`handleSetConfig` validates and persists the new track columns and settings;
`handleGetConfig`/`handleGetData` return them. `handleGetData` also returns
`user: {id, name}` so the client can show who is signed in.

**`server/src/index.js`** - resolve the session once, before routing, and build
the scoped `Db` from it:

```js
const session = await getSessionUser(env.DB, bearer(request));
if (!session) return unauthorized();
const db = new Db(env.DB, session.user_id);
```

`OPTIONS`, `POST /api/login`, and `POST /api/users` run before that (the last
gated by `ADMIN_TOKEN` instead). Update the route table in the file header
comment - it is this API's real documentation - with the new routes and the
per-user scoping.

## Phase 3 - Client (`client/public/index.html`)

- Gate gains a **Name** field above the password field (`tracker_name` in
  `localStorage`, prefilled). Submit posts `/api/login`; on success store the
  returned **token** - never the password - and `boot()`. On 401: "That name
  and password don't match."
- Header shows `Signed in as <name>` from `state.user` plus **Log out**, which
  calls `POST /api/logout` then clears `tracker_token`, `tracker_name`, and the
  `bjs.tab` / `bjs.view` / `bjs.leadSort` / `bjs.appSort` prefs, so the next
  person on this browser doesn't land on a tab that isn't theirs.
- The existing 401 handler clears the same keys.
- Nothing else changes: title, tabs, and location tiers already render from
  `/api/config`, which is now per-user.
- Mirror any new settings in `defaultSettings()` - the deliberate client/server
  duplication this repo uses in place of a build step.

## Phase 4 - Scripts (both users, one machine)

**`scripts/run-search.ps1`** - `-Task <track key> -User <user-id>`. Reads
`<DataDir>\<user-id>\tracker.json` (`{url, token}`, gitignored) for that user's
long-lived `scheduled-search` session token, falling back to
`TRACKER_URL`/`TRACKER_API_TOKEN` when absent so today's single-user setup keeps
working. Fetches the prompt from `GET /api/prompt/<task>` instead of reading
`scheduled-tasks\<task>.md`, sets the job's working directory to
`<DataDir>\<user-id>`, and passes the token into the child process as
`TRACKER_API_TOKEN` (the prompt's own `curl` calls still read it from the
environment). Logs to `<DataDir>\<user-id>\logs\<task>.log`. The headless "do
not background any of this" preamble stays here - it describes how *this
runner* invokes the CLI, not the search.

**`scripts/setup-scheduler.ps1`** - discovers users by scanning for
`<DataDir>\*\tracker.json`, then each user's tracks from their `/api/config`
rather than from `*.md` files. Registers `JobSearch-<user-slug>-<TrackSuffix>`
per track at that track's `schedule_time`, auto-staggering blanks.
**Its stale-task cleanup must be scoped to the users this run processed** -
today it unregisters every `JobSearch-*` task not in its own list, so setting up
a second user would silently delete the first user's entire schedule.

## Phase 5 - Skill and docs

**`.claude/skills/job-search-setup/SKILL.md`** - new step 0: identify the user
(existing name, or provision one via `POST /api/users`), mint their
`scheduled-search` session token via `/api/login`, and create
`private/<user-id>/{resumes,docs,logs}` + `tracker.json`. Step 4 stops writing
`scheduled-tasks/<key>.md` and instead posts the track's search config to
`/api/config` (the GET-merge-POST warning still applies, now per-user); it still
writes the per-track doc from `templates/tracked-postings.template.md`. Step 5
previews the real composed prompt via `GET /api/prompt/<key>`. Step 7 passes the
user to `setup-scheduler.ps1`. Delete `templates/scheduled-task.template.md` -
it now lives in `server/src/prompt.js`.

**Docs**: `server/README.md` (users/sessions, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, provisioning,
per-user scoping, the new routes, new config fields, `API_TOKEN` removal),
`client/README.md` (name + password gate, log out), `private.example/README.md`
(new `private/<user-id>/` layout; prompts are no longer files), root
`README.md` (multi-user setup + the rollout order below).
`docs/architecture.svg` and `docs/architecture.html` still describe a
single-user, prompt-file-driven flow - update their labels last, once the code
has settled.

## Rollout order (there is live data in the deployed D1)

**[`server/README.md`](../server/README.md)'s "Migrating an existing
deployment to multi-user" is the authority, and the only copy to follow.** A
one-shot procedure against live data should not exist in two documents that
can drift apart - and this one already had. The steps that used to be written
out here were wrong in two ways by the time the code was finished: they said
to insert the raw `API_TOKEN` as a session id (sessions store a SHA-256 now,
so that row would be dead and every scheduled search would 401 on deploy),
and they claimed nothing failed between migrating and deploying.

The shape of it, for context:

- Back up, and **disable the scheduled tasks first**. Between the migration
  and the deploy, the old Worker is talking to the new schema and its writes
  fail - some silently, returning a success-shaped `{"added": 0}` to a search
  that then reports a clean run having discarded everything it found.
- Migrate, set `ADMIN_TOKEN`, carry the existing token over as a session row
  (its hash, not the token), deploy both halves.
- Rename the backfill account and set its password using **the same name** -
  a mismatch creates a second, empty account instead.
- Post each track's search config, diff the composed prompts against the
  files they replace, then re-enable the tasks and retire the old ones.
  Re-enabling before the config is posted is its own trap: the server refuses
  to compose a prompt for a track with no config (409), so such a run fails
  loudly rather than searching for nothing in particular.

## Verification

There is no test suite in this repo; verification is curl plus the real UI.

- Local: `wrangler d1 migrations apply --local` + `wrangler dev`, create two
  users through the admin route, then prove isolation - B's `/api/data`
  contains none of A's leads; `POST /api/leads/<A's lead id>/status` with B's
  token 404s; `POST /api/runs` with B's token and A's track key 404s "unknown
  track"; `/api/config` and `/api/prompt/<key>` differ per token.
- Auth: wrong password 401s; wrong name 401s with the same message;
  `/api/users` without `ADMIN_TOKEN` 401s; `POST /api/logout` then reusing that
  token 401s; a second session for the same user survives the first's logout.
- Confirm the migration preserved data: row counts and a spot check of lead ids
  before/after, all now carrying the backfill GUID.
- Client: sign in as each user, check title/tabs/name, log out, confirm the gate
  returns and the other user's tab selection isn't inherited.
- End to end: `run-search.ps1 -Task <key> -User <id>` for the new user, then
  check the log and that the track's tab reports its last run.
- Prompt parity: see the appendix's diff gate. No `.md` prompt gets deleted
  until its composed replacement diffs clean against it.

## Worth knowing

- `/api/login` has no rate limiting - a guessable password is now brute-forcible
  over the internet in a way a 32-byte token never was. PBKDF2 at 100k makes
  each attempt cost real worker CPU (which is also its own small DoS surface).
  Use long passwords; a per-name attempt throttle is a reasonable follow-up.
- Both users' searches run under one machine's single `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`,
  i.e. on the machine owner's Claude account. Stagger the schedule times - each
  run takes minutes and they share the CLI.
- Isolation here is app-level, not privacy from the operator: whoever holds the
  Cloudflare account can read either user's rows directly in D1.

# Appendix - what `prompt.js` has to carry

> Snapshot of the design as drafted, not of the file as it stands. `prompt.js`
> has gained steps since (dedup endpoint, multi-tab filing, company rotation);
> read it rather than this for what a prompt contains today.

## The finding

The live per-track prompts are **not** filled-in copies of
`templates/scheduled-task.template.md`. They have been hand-edited since they
were generated, and several of those edits are operationally load-bearing.
Anything that decomposes a prompt into keyword-ish columns and re-synthesizes
the prose loses them. Checked against all three live prompts and the deployed
`/api/config`.

**Would have been lost by a naive structured-columns port:**

| What | Where | Why it matters | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| The per-track doc filename | steps 1, 8b | All three live tracks use legacy doc names that predate the one-slug convention, not `tracked_<key>_postings.md`. Deriving the path points every existing track at a file that doesn't exist. | `tracks.doc_file` |
| The resume line's fallback file | step 2 | The `.docx` is not readable on the machine that runs the searches (no pandoc/python/LibreOffice), so the `.txt` fallback is what actually gets read. One track has a *different*, conditional fallback that also instructs the model to report which file it used. | `tracks.resume_line`, verbatim |
| The candidate blurb | step 2 | It is **per track**, not per user - the three tracks frame the same resume three different ways for three different role types. | `tracks.candidate_blurb`, not a user setting |
| A hand-added sentence widening the company search | step 3 | In no template. It tells the model not to treat the company list as an industry filter, which materially widens what gets surfaced. A JSON `target_companies` array drops it silently. | `tracks.search_note` |
| The geo-scope paragraph, with its worked examples of excluded locations and its "record exclusions via step 9b" hookup | step 5 | Storing a keyword like `"US only"` and generating a sentence loses both the examples and the step-9b wiring. | `geo_scope_line` setting, verbatim |
| The location-string guidance: explicit city lists per priority tier **plus** the string-format conventions (`"Remote (U.S.)"`, "include city and state") | step 6 | **Deriving this from `priority_locations` does not work.** The live rules contain a substring the guidance doesn't mention, and contain no formatting conventions at all - derivation would both add and drop instructions. | `location_guidance` setting, verbatim |
| A closing guardrail naming a historical file to leave alone | footer | In no template. Stops the model editing an archived spreadsheet. | `footer_note` setting |
| The doc's real section headings, named inline | step 8b | Tells the model where in the doc to write its fetch-reliability notes. | `tracks.doc_sections` |
| A track-specific screening example | step 9b | Sharper than the template's generic "below target level". | `tracks.screened_examples` |
| One track's step 10, which asks for a fit note and for flagging roles where the candidate likely has a personal connection | step 10 | Step 10 has drifted per track too. | `tracks.report_line`, verbatim when set |
| The installer's name and pronouns | steps 1b, 6b, 8 | A second user needs their own. | `pronouns` setting, defaulting to they/them |

**Confirmed safe to treat as shared boilerplate** - byte-identical across all
three live prompts, and the part that most needs to stay correct as the API
changes: steps 1b, 4, 5, 6, 6b, 8, 9, 9b, 9c. Today they are copy-pasted three
times, which is exactly why `private.example/README.md` has to warn that a
hand-authored prompt may be missing step 9c. Centralizing them is the real win
here; the per-track prose is what has to stay verbatim.

**Deliberate normalizations** - differences the composer introduces knowingly.
None change behaviour; all should be eyeballed once:

- A stale dated parenthetical in step 1 is dropped.
- Step 7(c)'s tail becomes "duplicate of an existing lead" on every track (two
  tracks say just "duplicate" today).
- Step 1b's "the same dead/out-of-scope candidate" is used everywhere (one
  track says "closed/wrong-fit").
- The header's summary line comes from `full_description` rather than each
  file's hand-written variant. It's a comment line the model doesn't act on.
- One track has no sibling-tracks note today despite having two siblings;
  `intro_note` is stored verbatim, so it stays absent rather than being
  helpfully added.

## The column set this implies

Structured where the *app* reads it (`key`, `label`, `full_description`,
`sort_order`, `schedule_time`, `target_companies`); **verbatim prose where only
the model reads it**. That split is the finding - going further and decomposing
the prose is what loses things.

- **`tracks`**: `role_search_line`, `target_companies` (JSON array),
  `search_note`, `candidate_blurb`, `resume_line`, `fit_clause`,
  `fit_disqualifier`, `doc_file`, `doc_summary`, `doc_sections`, `intro_note`,
  `report_line`, `screened_examples`, `schedule_time`.
- **`meta` settings**: `geo_scope_line`, `scope_clause`, `scope_disqualifier`,
  `location_guidance`, `footer_note`, `pronouns`.

## Draft `server/src/prompt.js`

```js
/**
 * Composes one track's daily search prompt from its D1 config.
 *
 * This replaces .claude/skills/job-search-setup/templates/scheduled-task.template.md
 * and the per-track .md copies of it that used to live in the private data
 * folder. The reason it moved here: steps 1b/8/9/9b/9c are this API's own
 * calling convention, they were byte-identical in all three hand-copies, and a
 * copy that silently lacked 9c was a documented, real failure mode. Those steps
 * now have exactly one definition, next to the routes they call.
 *
 * The per-track prose (candidate blurb, resume line, search note, report line)
 * is stored and emitted VERBATIM, not synthesized from keywords. That is
 * deliberate - see docs/multi-user-plan.md's appendix: every load-bearing thing
 * the live prompts had that the template didn't was prose someone hand-added.

# Track key in the tracker data: ${key}
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

${intro}Do the following:

1. Read \`${doc}\` - ${track.doc_summary}. Follow its numbered process. The doc doesn't keep a found-postings table or a screened/dead-link list of its own - dedup data comes from step 1b instead.
1b. Fetch the tracker's current data: \`curl -s "$TRACKER_URL/api/data" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRACKER_API_TOKEN"\`. This returns \`leads[]\` (postings already tracked - keep each one's \`url\` and \`status\` on hand for step 8, it's how you tell a stale lead nobody's touched from one ${name} has already applied to) and \`screened[]\` (postings already looked at and rejected - keep each one's \`url\` on hand for step 7, so you don't re-verify the same dead/out-of-scope candidate every run).
2. ${track.resume_line}
3. Search target companies' careers sites (web search as backup) for current ${track.role_search_line}. Companies: ${companies}.${searchNote} Also run the doc's broader-discovery step.
4. MANDATORY VERIFICATION: fetch every candidate URL directly and confirm it renders an actual job description (real title, responsibilities/qualifications - not a landing page, 404, "job not found," a loading placeholder, or a listing/index page that merely contains the title text). A search-snippet URL is a lead, not a finding, until opened and confirmed. If a site won't reveal real content, skip that company today rather than report something unverified.
5. ${settings.geo_scope_line}
6. ${settings.location_guidance}
6b. While the posting is open, also capture - only when it's stated plainly, never inferred or guessed - the team/org named for the role (\`team\`), the stated work arrangement (\`setup\`, e.g. "Remote", "Hybrid - 3 days/week onsite", "Onsite"), and any posted compensation range (\`comp\`, e.g. "$180,000-$230,000/yr"; many US states disclose this by law). Leave any of these as an empty string when the posting doesn't say. These land in the tracker's per-lead "Details" panel alongside referral/resume/next-action fields that are ${name}'s alone to fill in by hand - this search never touches those.
7. Compare candidate URLs against \`leads[]\` and \`screened[]\` from step 1b (not a doc table). Sort each candidate into: (a) already tracked or already screened - skip it; (b) ${findingIs} - a finding, goes to step 9; (c) genuinely new but disqualified (${disqualified}) - goes to step 9b instead of being dropped silently.
8. For a previously-tracked lead (from step 1b's \`leads[]\`) confirmed dead on this check, **never remove or move it** - it stays a lead. Use the step-1b tracker data (match by \`url\`) to call \`POST /api/update\` marking it delisted:
   \`\`\`
   curl -s -X POST "$TRACKER_URL/api/update" \\
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRACKER_API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{"type":"lead","id":<its id>,"delistedOn":"<today YYYY-MM-DD>"}'
   \`\`\`
   This is independent of \`status\` (Applied, Interviewing, etc. are untouched) - ${name} still needs to track what ${pn.subj} applied to regardless of whether the listing survives. If a posting previously marked delisted is found live again, clear it the same way with \`"delistedOn":""\`. If the tracker's unreachable, skip the API call and note it in your report - don't guess an id.
8b. If you learned something about fetch reliability worth keeping - a newly-blocked domain, a working URL-format fix, a company worth promoting from "expanded net" to "core" - update the relevant section of \`${doc}\`${docSections}. Do not add a found-postings table or a screened/dead-link list back to the doc; those live in the tracker only.
9. SYNC NEW POSTINGS TO THE LIVE TRACKER WEBPAGE. [...the live step 9, verbatim, with "search":"${key}"...]
9b. RECORD SCREENED-OUT CANDIDATES. [...the live step 9b, verbatim, "search":"${key}", examples: ${track.screened_examples}...]
9c. RECORD THE RUN. [...the live step 9c, verbatim, "search":"${key}"...]
10. ${report}

Never add an unverified link to any output.${settings.footer_note ? " " + settings.footer_note : ""}`;
}
```

Steps 9/9b/9c are elided above only for length - in the real file they are the
live text verbatim, with the hardcoded track key replaced by `${key}`. They are
the whole reason this moved server-side, so they get copied exactly, not
paraphrased.

## The diff gate

Before deleting a single `.md`: seed the existing tracks' columns from the
current files, then for each track,
`GET /api/prompt/<key> | diff - <data dir>/scheduled-tasks/<file>.md`. Expect
only the normalizations listed above - anything else is a real loss. Do this
against a **local** `wrangler dev`, before any of it goes near the deployed
worker.
