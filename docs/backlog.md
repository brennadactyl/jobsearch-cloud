# Backlog

What is worth building next, and why, ranked. Not a plan and not a promise: an
item leaves this list when it gets a plan of its own or ships.

Kept by whoever is holding the product manager role.

## Next

- **Team skills and tools** - approved from every role's workflow review. In
  order: commit the proof tools under `tools/` (comment-only checks, one prompt
  snapshot, the tracker helper rig, the doc link checker and diagram generator)
  with a `prove-a-change` skill; fix `verify-and-deploy`; three CLAUDE.md lines;
  then skills for testing the page against a local server, live end-to-end
  tests, rebuilding a search's doc and PowerShell script conventions; fixes to
  `edit-tracker-page`, `job-search-setup`, `add-target-company` and
  `change-search-prompt`; a nightly run report and a backup query script.
- **[Account settings](account-settings-plan.md), the rest** - the resume and
  locations sections and "My account" are live. Still to build: editing the page
  title, pronouns, excluded companies and search names, and the setup answers
  the night turns into prose. Needs its own mockup pass first.
- **An `attempts` column on `intake`** - the retry bound is a three-day rule on
  `sent_at` today, which is the right stop in the wrong unit. Counting nights is
  one column and one increment, and needs its own migration.

- **Recover a failed setup.** A setup that fails on its own answers - a resume
  that turns out unreadable - has no way forward today: the form is one-shot, so
  the person cannot do what the failure note asks. [Account
  settings](account-settings-plan.md) is the fix; until it ships the notes say
  to ask whoever invited them.
- **Split `db.js`, moving the shared company list into its own module**, ahead of
  any work that touches the company list or coverage. At ~1,850 lines it is the
  file every server feature edits, and it mixes per-person data with the one
  list every account shares.

- **One CLI-failure check for all three runners.** `run-search`, `run-fill` and
  `run-onboarding` each find the CLI and recognise "not logged in" their own way,
  and the wordings have drifted, so a new CLI message can fail the fill silently
  while the searches catch it. Detection becomes one shared helper; what each
  run does about it stays its own. Onboarding stops putting an operator's login
  problem on a person's page: it leaves the intake pending and fails loudly in
  the log. Owner: Prompt Bro, as its own change with a stub-CLI test per wording.

- **Refuse a search whose documents are all unreadable.** The prompt route
  refuses an empty `documents` list, but a list naming only `.docx` passes and
  the run screens on its profile alone. The same readable-format check belongs
  there, in the onboarding run's validation, and in the account panel's picker.
  Owner: Prompt Bro, with Backend Buddy for the route.

## Worth doing, unscheduled

- **[Split user tokens from machine tokens](token-split-plan.md)** - planned;
  unassigned. Every session token reaches every route today, so a search's
  token on a machine can rewrite config or delete leads.
- **Rate-limit `/api/login` and `/api/signup`.** Both are public and unthrottled;
  password length is the only defence. `server/README.md` says so in its own
  security notes.
- **Tokens never expire.** Revoking means deleting a `sessions` row by hand.
- **A privacy posture for strangers.** Whoever administers the Cloudflare
  account can read every account's rows in D1. Honest for friends; with
  strangers' resumes it needs a retention policy and a deletion path a person
  can invoke themselves. The delete-account route is the operator half of this.
- **Company discovery as its own nightly job**
  (planned on the unmerged `company-discovery-plan` branch) - searches
  re-evaluate the same companies on the same nights.

## Small

- A stray phrase in `prompt.js` step 3b, "when the named list reads as big
  tech", left over from per-search company lists. Next change that touches
  `prompt.js`.
- Adding or removing a search from the account panel: a new role means a new
  tab, and removing one has leads and applications hanging off it.
- The run record counts leads added, screened and swept per day, so two runs
  of one search on the same day are counted together in the nightly run report.

## Watching

- **The first nights without per-search company lists, and with the run queue.**
  Compare companies covered, leads found, run length and queue waits against the
  week before.
- **Whether an empty first morning is normal.** The page now says it is. The one
  run that produced it had an inverted scope, so it is not yet evidence.
