# Job Search Tracker API (Cloudflare Worker + D1)

The API-only backend: a small JSON API over a real SQL database (Cloudflare
D1, which is SQLite), so the headless search CLI can update it with a `curl`
call and concurrent writes (a search syncing new leads while you're editing a
status) don't race and silently clobber each other - each row is its own
database record with its own atomic writes, not one big JSON blob.

This worker serves **no HTML** - the tracker webpage is a separate deployable
at [`../client/`](../client/), served from its own origin (typically
Cloudflare Pages) and talking to this API cross-origin (CORS is on by
default, see `src/http.js`). Server and client are versioned, deployed, and
updated independently - a client redeploy never needs a server redeploy and
vice versa, as long as both are compatible with the API described below.

No personal data lives in this repo - the actual data (company names, URLs,
your notes) lives only in D1 once deployed.

One deployment holds **any number of people's job searches**. Every row
carries a `user_id`, and every request is scoped to whoever's token made it,
so two people share a worker and a database while seeing entirely separate
tracks, leads, applications, page titles and location rules.

## Code layout

- `src/index.js` - the entry point, and nothing else: the CORS preflight
  (`OPTIONS`), resolving the caller's session once up front, building the one
  `Db` scoped to that person, and dispatching to the route table. It knows
  about no individual endpoint.
- `src/routes/index.js` - the route table: which method and path map to which
  handler, in two lists split by whether the caller is known yet. Adding an
  endpoint is one line here plus one exported function in the module beside
  it.
- `src/routes/*.js` - one module per resource (`leads.js`, `applications.js`,
  `screened.js`, `config.js`, `coverage.js`, `runs.js`, `prompt.js`,
  `data.js`, `accounts.js`, `admin.js`, `update.js`, `delisting.js`). Each
  holds its endpoints' parsing, validation and response shaping, and each
  endpoint's contract is documented on its own handler. No D1 access of their
  own - every one is handed a `Db`.
- `src/http.js` - every `Response` this worker builds: `json()`, `text()`, the
  two canned refusals, and `CORS_HEADERS` on all of them. Route modules never
  construct a `Response` themselves, which is what keeps the header on the
  error replies too.
- `src/validate.js` - the checks more than one route makes: `isoDate`, the
  unknown-track refusals, the exclusion matcher.
- `src/auth.js` - passwords (PBKDF2 via Web Crypto), session tokens, and
  looking a bearer token up to a user. The only file that touches either.
- `src/db.js` - all D1 access for a person's own data. Every instance is
  bound to one user id at construction, so no query can forget to filter.
- `src/r2.js` - all R2 access for their documents: resumes, and the per-track
  baseline doc the nightly search reads and edits. Scoped the same way `db.js`
  is - every key is prefixed with the owner's id at construction, so no method
  can address another person's object. An object's key is
  `<user-id>/<relative path>`, and there is no table beside it: `kind` is the
  first path segment and R2's own `list()` returns the rest.
- `src/prompt.js` - composes the two prompts the scheduled runs execute:
  `buildSearchPrompt`, one track's daily search, from that track's config; and
  `buildAutofillPrompt`, the nightly fill for applications logged as a bare
  URL, which takes no arguments because it is the same text for everybody.
- `verify-local.mjs` - the cross-user isolation checks, run against a local
  `wrangler dev`. `verify-migration.mjs` - what `0002` does to a database that
  already has data. `verify-schema-doc.mjs` - that `../docs/schema.md` matches
  what the migrations build; CI runs it. See [Verifying](#verifying-a-change)
  below.
- `migrations/` - `0001_schema.sql` creates every table; `0002_multi_user.sql`
  adds accounts and gives every table an owner. See below. The tables all of
  them add up to are described in [`../docs/schema.md`](../docs/schema.md).

## One-time setup

You need to do the account creation and login yourself - not something that
can be done on your behalf.

### First: turn on R2

**Do this before either path below.** This worker binds an R2 bucket for
documents - resumes and each track's baseline doc (see [`src/r2.js`](src/r2.js)).
R2 is off by default on a new Cloudflare account, and nothing can create a
bucket until it is switched on: the deploy button's auto-provisioning and
`wrangler` alike fail with

```
Please enable R2 through the Cloudflare Dashboard. [code: 10042]
```

To enable it: **[dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → R2 Object
Storage** (under **Storage & databases**) **→ Overview**, then complete the
checkout flow to add an R2 subscription. It is a subscription with a free
allowance rather than a paid plan - 10 GB of storage, 1 million writes and 10
million reads a month, and no egress charges - so Cloudflare wants billing
details on file, but this deployment's documents run to about a megabyte and
stay inside the free tier by three or four orders of magnitude.

Confirm it took (in PowerShell, `npx.cmd` - see the note above):

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket list
```

An empty list is the answer you want. The 10042 above means it did not take.

If you would rather not enable R2 at all, the tracker still runs without it:
every other endpoint works, and the four `/api/documents` routes answer 503
saying documents are not configured. What you lose is the document store - the
searches then need their baseline docs and resumes on the machine that runs
them, which is where they lived before.

### Quick deploy (recommended)

No Node.js or `wrangler` CLI required locally - the build/deploy happens in
Cloudflare's own environment.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/brennadactyl/JobSearchTracker/tree/main/server)

1. Click the button, sign in to Cloudflare (creates a free account if you
   don't have one), and accept the defaults on the setup page it shows you.
2. It forks this `server/` directory into a new repo in your own GitHub, and
   reads `wrangler.toml` to auto-provision both a D1 database and the R2
   documents bucket for you (filling in the `database_id` for you - nothing to
   paste in by hand). `package.json`'s `deploy` script (`wrangler d1 migrations
   apply DB --remote && wrangler deploy`) runs the schema migrations and
   deploys in one step.

   The bucket is only auto-provisioned if you enabled R2 first - see above.
   Skip that and this step is where it fails.
3. It lands you on your new Worker's dashboard. Go to **Settings → Variables
   and Secrets** and add a secret named `ADMIN_TOKEN` - any long random value
   you pick (a password generator, or `-join ((48..57)+(97..122)|Get-Random
   -Count 40|%{[char]$_})` in PowerShell, works fine). This is done through
   the dashboard UI, no CLI needed. It is **not** a login: it's the operator
   credential that creates accounts and resets passwords, nothing else.
4. Your Worker's URL is shown on that same dashboard page (something like
   `https://job-search-tracker.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`). You'll need it
   for the client (see [`../client/README.md`](../client/README.md)) and in
   each person's `tracker.json` on whatever machine runs their searches.
5. **Create your account** - see [Accounts](#accounts) below. A fresh database
   has none, and there is no sign-up page.
6. Now deploy the client - see [`../client/README.md`](../client/README.md).
   It's a separate one-click deploy; this worker alone has no webpage.

### Manual setup (alternative, or for updating an existing deployment)

1. **Create a free Cloudflare account** at https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
   (if you don't have one already).

2. **Install Wrangler** (Cloudflare's CLI) and log in:
   ```bat
   npm install -g wrangler
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Create the D1 database:**
   ```bat
   cd server
   wrangler d1 create job-search-tracker-db
   ```
   It prints a `database_id`. Paste it into `wrangler.toml`, replacing
   `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID`.

4. **Create the documents bucket:**
   ```bat
   wrangler r2 bucket create job-search-tracker-docs
   ```
   Unlike D1 there is no id to paste - `wrangler.toml` binds it by name, so
   this only has to match. If it errors with `[code: 10042]`, R2 is not enabled
   on the account yet; see "First: turn on R2" above.

5. **Apply the schema:**
   ```bat
   wrangler d1 migrations apply job-search-tracker-db --remote
   ```
   Every table, no seed data, and no accounts. Your tracks, page title and
   priority locations are set later via `/api/config` (the `job-search-setup`
   skill does it), so the page is deliberately empty until then rather than
   pre-filled with someone else's job search.

6. **Set the admin token.** This creates accounts and resets passwords; it is
   not a login and nothing else accepts it. Pick a long random value:
   ```powershell
   -join ((48..57)+(97..122)|Get-Random -Count 40|%{[char]$_})
   ```
   Then:
   ```bat
   wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN
   ```

7. **Deploy:**
   ```bat
   wrangler deploy
   ```
   Prints your live URL, something like
   `https://job-search-tracker.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

8. **Create your account** and mint the token your scheduled searches will
   use - see [Accounts](#accounts) below.

9. **Deploy the client** - see [`../client/README.md`](../client/README.md).

## Accounts

There is no sign-up page, and deliberately so: this is a handful of people
who know each other, not a service. Accounts are created by whoever operates
the deployment, using the `ADMIN_TOKEN` secret.

**Changing a password is not an operator job, though.** Anyone signed in can
change their own from the tracker page (click "Signed in as ..." in the header),
which posts `/api/password` with their current password alongside their
session. That route is the only one that sets a password without the admin
secret, and it is deliberately narrow - see [Changing your own
password](#changing-your-own-password) below. The admin path stays for the two
cases it is actually for: making an account, and resetting a password nobody
knows any more.

**Create someone (or reset their password)** - same call either way, because
nothing else in the system can hash a password:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$TRACKER_URL/api/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Their Name","password":"a-long-password-they-pick"}'
```

Returns `{"id": "<guid>", "name": "...", "created": true|false}`. The id is
what every row of theirs is keyed by; it never changes, so a password reset
or a rename leaves their data alone. Passwords must be at least 12
characters - `/api/login` has no rate limiting in front of it, so length is
the whole defence (see [Security](#security-notes)).

**Sign in** - the webpage does this for them. Do it by hand once per machine
that runs their searches, to mint the long-lived token for the scheduled
runs:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$TRACKER_URL/api/login" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Their Name","password":"...","label":"scheduled-search"}'
```

Returns `{"token": "...", "user": {...}}`. Put that token, with the worker
URL, in `<data dir>/<their id>/tracker.json` (see
[`../private.example/README.md`](../private.example/README.md)). The password
itself never goes on disk.

### Changing your own password

Signed in, from the page. `POST /api/password` takes `currentPassword` and
`newPassword`, and it requires both the session and the current password.

**The session token alone is deliberately not enough.** A token copied off a
shared machine already reads and writes that person's data, which is bad and
recoverable - they can sign out everywhere. If the same token could set the
password, it would turn that into "someone has your account and you don't",
which is not recoverable without the operator.

**Sessions survive it by default**, the same promise `POST /api/users` makes.
The one that matters is the long-lived token a scheduled search keeps in
`tracker.json`: a password change that revoked it would stop that person's
nightly search silently, and a search that never fired looks exactly like one
that found nothing, so they would find out weeks later from an empty tab.

`signOutOthers: true` is the opt-in for when that isn't what you want - you
are changing it *because* something is wrong. It revokes only sessions
labelled `browser`, and not the one making the request. That filter is an
allowlist of what may be revoked rather than a denylist of what must be
spared, on purpose: written the other way round, any credential someone later
labels something else - a second machine, a script - would die the first time
anybody changed their password. An unrecognised label is kept, so the worst
case is a session that should have gone and didn't, which they can see and log
out of.

This is the first thing to use `sessions.label` the way it was added to be
used: revoking a credential by what it is rather than by guessing which opaque
string is which.

**Revoke one credential.** `label` is why sessions are worth having: a
browser signing out kills only its own token, and you can drop a leaked
scheduled-search token without disturbing anyone's browser.

```bash
wrangler d1 execute job-search-tracker-db --remote \
  --command "DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id = '<guid>' AND label = 'scheduled-search'"
```

**See who exists, and what they hold.** `sessions.id` is a SHA-256 of the
token, not the token, so this (and a `d1 export`) shows what exists without
handing out anything usable:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute job-search-tracker-db --remote \
  --command "SELECT u.name, s.label, s.created_at FROM users u LEFT JOIN sessions s ON s.user_id = u.id ORDER BY u.name"
```

Sessions have no expiry and nothing prunes them, so a person who signs in
from a lot of browsers accumulates rows. Harmless, but that's the query to
notice it with, and a `DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id = '<guid>'` signs
that person out everywhere.

## Updating after code changes

**Always deploy from `main`, never from a feature branch or worktree** -
merge/fast-forward `main` and push first, then deploy from a checkout that's
actually on `main`. `wrangler deploy` and `wrangler d1 migrations apply
--remote` both push whatever's on disk live regardless of git branch, so
deploying from a branch leaves the live Worker running code that isn't in
`main`'s history.

```bat
cd server
wrangler deploy
```

### Migrating an existing deployment to multi-user

`0002_multi_user.sql` gives every table an owner and replaces the old shared
`API_TOKEN` with accounts.

> **The window between migrating and deploying is not safe, and it fails
> quietly.** Once the migration has run, the *old* Worker code is talking to
> the *new* schema, and its writes don't work: `INSERT OR IGNORE` into `leads`
> and `screened` no longer matches the new UNIQUE constraint, so it inserts
> nothing and returns `{"added": 0}` - a success-shaped response a scheduled
> search will happily report a clean run on, having thrown away everything it
> found that morning. `/api/runs` and any status edit 500 outright, and an
> application added by hand lands with an empty `user_id` and is invisible
> afterwards. So: **disable the scheduled tasks first, and do steps 2-5 back
> to back**, outside every track's `schedule_time`.

1. **Back up first.** `wrangler d1 export job-search-tracker-db --remote
   --output backup.sql`. Then stop the searches for the duration:
   ```powershell
   Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "JobSearch-*" | Disable-ScheduledTask
   ```
2. `wrangler d1 migrations apply job-search-tracker-db --remote` - creates
   `users`/`sessions` and assigns every existing row to one account named
   `owner`, with login disabled (SQL can't hash a password).
3. `wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN` - a fresh value, not the old `API_TOKEN`.
4. Keep the running searches authenticating by turning the token they already
   have into a session. `sessions.id` holds the SHA-256 of a token, not the
   token, so insert the hash:
   ```powershell
   $t = "<the current API_TOKEN value>"
   $h = [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create().ComputeHash([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($t)))
   wrangler d1 execute job-search-tracker-db --remote --command "INSERT INTO sessions (id, user_id, created_at, label) VALUES ('$h', 'ab266b6c-00cc-45d1-92ac-cdad412c1558', date('now'), 'legacy scheduled search')"
   ```
   Nothing on the search machine changes - it keeps sending the same token -
   and the credential stays revocable by deleting that one row later.
5. `wrangler deploy`, then deploy the client. **Leave the tasks disabled** -
   they have nothing to run yet. The migration copies no search config, so
   until step 8 each track exists for the webpage but not for searching.
   `/api/prompt` returns a 409 for a track in that state rather than
   composing a prompt out of its generic fallbacks, so a run started early
   fails loudly instead of searching for nothing in particular and reporting
   success - but there's no reason to make it fail at all.
6. Give the account a real name and password. **The two names must match** -
   `POST /api/users` with a name that doesn't match an existing account
   creates a new empty one rather than setting the password on this one.
   (Case doesn't matter: `users.name` is `COLLATE NOCASE`.)
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 execute job-search-tracker-db --remote \
     --command "UPDATE users SET name = 'Your Name' WHERE name = 'owner'"
   curl -s -X POST "$TRACKER_URL/api/users" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Your Name","password":"..."}'
   ```
   Check it returned `"created": false`. If it says `true`, the names didn't
   match and you now have a second, empty account - delete it and retry.
   Then sign in on the webpage.
7. Delete the old `API_TOKEN` secret - its value now works only as that
   session row.
8. Move each track's search config into D1 and retire the prompt files. Post
   the config (the `job-search-setup` skill does this), then **diff before
   deleting anything**: `curl -s "$TRACKER_URL/api/prompt/<key>" -H
   "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` against the `.md` it replaces. Expect
   only wording normalizations; anything else means config is missing.
9. Move the data folder to `private\<user-id>\`, write its `tracker.json`
   (see [`../private.example/README.md`](../private.example/README.md)), then
   re-register the schedule and re-enable it:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\setup-scheduler.ps1
   Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "JobSearch-*" | Enable-ScheduledTask
   ```
   **Then unregister the old, pre-migration tasks.** They're named
   `JobSearch-<Track>` where the new ones are `JobSearch-<user>-<Track>`, so
   nothing replaces them and nothing cleans them up - left alone, each track
   would run twice a day, once through each task:
   ```powershell
   Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "JobSearch-*" |
     Where-Object { $_.TaskName -notmatch '^JobSearch-.+-' } |
     Unregister-ScheduledTask -Confirm:$false
   ```
10. Confirm a real run works end to end before trusting the schedule:
    `.\scripts\run-search.ps1 -Task <key> -User <user-id>`, then check the log
    and that the track's tab reports the run.

**If it goes wrong**, the recovery is the step-1 export: `wrangler d1 execute
job-search-tracker-db --remote --file backup.sql` against a database you've
dropped the tables from, or re-create the D1 and import there. There is no
down-migration - `0002` drops and recreates five tables, and a partially
applied run is not something to unpick by hand.

### The schema files

The base schema lives in one file, `migrations/0001_schema.sql`, which
creates every table a fresh database needs in a single pass and seeds
nothing. It replaced a seven-file migration history that had accumulated
around one bad early migration - since there has only ever been one
deployment, no database needed those files to reach the current state, and
collapsing them fixed a real bug that had made setting up a fresh database
impossible. Anything that consulted the old numbered files (`0004_add_lead_delisted.sql`
and friends, referenced from code comments) now points here.

Schema changes from here are still tracked migrations - Wrangler records
which files have run, so `apply` is always safe to re-run, executing only
what it hasn't seen. To add one:
```bat
cd server
wrangler d1 migrations create job-search-tracker-db <short-name>
```
Edit the generated file - using real `ALTER TABLE` statements - then apply it
the same way as step 4 above:
```bat
wrangler d1 migrations apply job-search-tracker-db --remote
```
Update [`../docs/schema.md`](../docs/schema.md) in the same change.

**Do not add a column by editing `0001_schema.sql`.** Against any database
that has already run it, an edit there does nothing at all: Wrangler skips
files it has already applied, and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op
against a table that exists, so the column silently never appears while the
file claims otherwise. That exact trap is what produced the history this file
replaced.

A schema/API change only requires redeploying `server/` - `client/` doesn't
need a redeploy unless it also needs to use the new field/route. Keep the API
additive (new optional fields, new routes) where you can, so old clients
don't break against a newer server; note any breaking change clearly in the
commit and in this README's API section below.


## API (used by the search scripts, see ../private.example/README.md, and by the client, see ../client/)

Every route except the three marked otherwise needs `Authorization: Bearer
<session token>`, and every one of them is **scoped to whoever that token
belongs to**. There is no user id in any request: another person's lead id,
application id or track key simply doesn't resolve, and comes back as a 404.

### Auth

- `POST /api/login` - **no auth** - body `{ name, password, label? }` -> `{ token, user: { id, name } }`, or `401` for both a wrong password and an unknown name (told apart, they'd enumerate who has an account). `label` records what the token is for (`"browser"`, `"scheduled-search"`) so it can be revoked by purpose later; defaults to `"browser"`. Tokens don't expire - the shared token they replaced didn't either, and a headless search that had to re-authenticate on a schedule would be a new failure mode for no gain.
- `POST /api/logout` - revokes **only the token that made the request**, so signing out of a browser leaves the scheduled search's credential alone.
- `POST /api/users` - **`ADMIN_TOKEN` as the Bearer, not a session** - body `{ name, password }` -> creates an account with a fresh GUID, or sets an existing name's password (`201` vs `200`, `{id, name, created}`). Doubles as password reset because nothing else can run PBKDF2. Minimum 12 characters. See [Accounts](#accounts).
- `POST /api/password` - body `{ currentPassword, newPassword, signOutOthers? }` -> `{ ok, signedOut }`. Changes the caller's own password. Requires the current one as well as the session - see [Changing your own password](#changing-your-own-password) for why the token alone is not enough. `403` for a wrong current password, `400` for a new one under 12 characters or identical to the old. Those are told apart in the reply, unlike `/api/login`'s deliberately ambiguous refusal: there is nothing to withhold from a caller already authenticated as this person, and the two need different corrections. Sessions survive by default; `signOutOthers: true` revokes only this person's other `browser`-labelled sessions and reports how many, never the scheduled search's. Absent, it defaults to false, so a scripted caller never gets a revocation it did not ask for.
- `GET /api/me` -> `{ id, name }` - who this token belongs to.

### Data

- `GET /api/data` - returns `{ user, updated, leads[], applications[], screened[], tracks[], settings }` - everything the page renders, for this person only. `user` is `{id, name}`, so the page can say whose search it's showing.
- `POST /api/leads` - body `{ "on": "YYYY-MM-DD", "leads": [ {search, company, title, location, url, fit, team, setup, comp} ] }` - appends only leads whose *posting* this user doesn't already have. Two layers of dedup: a canonical-URL match (see `src/url.js`) over the DB-enforced `UNIQUE(user_id, search, url)`, so the same posting arriving under a different URL - a `?gh_jid=` suffix, a slug, a tracking param - is caught as well as a byte-identical repeat. The scope is the *search*, not the tab: a branched run filling several tabs cannot file one posting into two of them, while two independent tracks each holding it stay two rows. Companies on `excluded_companies` are dropped here rather than trusted to the prompt. `on` is the caller's local date and is what `found`/`verified` are stamped with, so a posting doesn't need to repeat a date on every row. Never touches existing status/notes. Two people tracking the same posting are two independent rows. `team`/`setup`/`comp` are optional (omit rather than send empty) and only meaningful when the posting states them - other Details fields (referral, resume, lastContact, nextAction*, link) are accepted too but are user-entered only, never sent by the search scripts. Every distinct `search` in the payload must name one of your configured tracks - a fed tab counts, since a branched run legitimately files into one - and an unknown key gets a 404 naming it with **nothing inserted**, not even the rows whose key was fine: a half-applied payload leaves the run reporting rows it never filed, and treating those postings as already saved. This used to accept any string, which is how 145 leads accumulated under a retired key with no tab left to display them. Responds `{added, duplicates, excluded}`.
- `POST /api/screened` - body `{ "search": "SWE", "on": "YYYY-MM-DD", "screened": [ {search, url, company, title, location, reason} ] }` - records a posting the search looked at and decided NOT to add as a lead (dead-on-arrival, out of scope, wrong level, duplicate), so the next run's dedup check skips it without re-verifying. Same canonical dedup and exclusion handling as `/api/leads`. Rows are filed under the search that did the screening: for a branched run the `search` is rewritten to the track that owns the search, since nothing displays screened rows per tab. **Send `on`** - it is the date these rows carry, and `/api/runs` counts a day's screened rows by it, so omitting it on an evening run stamps them with the worker's UTC date (already tomorrow) and the run records having screened nothing. `reason` is free text with one reserved value: `"posting taken down"` is the server's own marker for a delisted lead and is rewritten if a caller sends it, so an ordinary screening can't be counted as a delisting. Same configured-track check as `/api/leads` - unknown key, 404, nothing inserted - and it is applied to the `search` the caller sent, before the `fed_by` rewrite, because the string a drifted prompt gets wrong is the one it sent. Responds `{added, duplicates, excluded}`.
- `POST /api/runs` - body `{ "search": "SWE", "status": "ok"|"error", "on": "YYYY-MM-DD", "note": "..." }` - records that one track's scheduled search just finished. **Called at the end of every run, including runs that found nothing** - that's the whole point: a run that finds nothing writes no leads, no screened rows and no `updated` bump, so without this a search that quietly stopped firing is indistinguishable from a genuine zero-result day. **The counts are not supplied by the caller.** `leadsAdded`, `screenedAdded` and `delisted` are derived from the rows themselves (`db.countRunActivity`) - counted per track from that track's own rows on that date - because a run that had to tally them itself got them wrong: one multi-tab run reported its four tabs' combined total against a single tab and left the other three with no record at all. They are still accepted in the body and ignored, so a run part-way through a night on an older prompt keeps recording correctly. One POST also writes a record for **every tab this run feeds** (`fed_by`), which is what stops a branched search's other tabs reading as never-run; the response is `{ok, run, also}`, where `also` carries those extra records. `on` is the caller's *local* date (the worker only knows UTC, and a morning run is already the next UTC day) and is the date the counts are taken on; `status: "error"` marks a run that couldn't do its job, which the client surfaces as a warning. 404s on a `search` that isn't one of *this person's* configured tracks.
- `POST /api/update` - body `{ "type": "lead", "id": ..., "status": "...", "notes": "...", "search": "..." }` or `{ "type": "application", ... }`. All fields are optional per call, and all but one are plain field writes. **`delistedOn` is the exception: the server acts on it rather than storing it.** A scheduled search sending `delistedOn` is reporting that a posting it tracks is gone from the internet; what the tracker does about that is decided in `routes/delisting.js`'s `removeDelistedLead`, not by the caller - a lead that hasn't been applied to is deleted and its URL written into `screened` in one transaction (so tomorrow's run doesn't rediscover it and add it straight back), and a lead an application row points at (normally one marked "Applied") is kept untouched, because what's tracked from then on is the application rather than whether the listing outlived it. The response says which happened: `{"removed": true, "screened": "<url>"}` or `{"removed": false, "lead": {...}}`; `removed` is what the DELETE actually matched, so a second report of the same lead comes back `false`. `delistedOn` must be a `YYYY-MM-DD` date - anything else is a 400, because what it triggers is a permanent delete and a value that isn't a date isn't a report of anything. **The report can't be undone.** The lead row is gone and its URL sits in `screened`, which the next run skips, so a posting reported dead by mistake does not come back on its own - putting it back means deleting the `screened` row and re-adding the lead by hand. (`"delistedOn": ""` is still accepted and ignored - there is no stored delisted state left to clear - but nothing instructs a run to send it.) A lead also accepts `search`, which **moves it to another of this person's tabs** - the case that comes up when one track is split in two and the leads the old search already filed need re-filing. It 404s on a track key this person doesn't have and 409s when the destination tab already holds that url (`UNIQUE(user_id, search, url)`); a `delistedOn` report is the only thing that deletes a lead, so a move is how a mis-filed one gets where it belongs.
- `POST /api/leads/:id/status` - body `{ status }` - validates against `LEAD_STATUS`; if the new status is "Applied", atomically also creates the matching application row unless one already exists.
- `POST /api/applications/:id/status` - body `{ status }` - validates against `APP_STATUS`; stamps the matching Stage history date if that column is still empty.
- `POST /api/delete-application` - body `{ "id": ... }` - removes one application row.

#### Applications added as nothing but a URL

Logging an application by hand was nine fields copied off a posting open in
the next tab. The tracker page now takes the URL alone, and a nightly run
reads the posting and fills the rest in - **one task for the whole machine**,
not one per person (`JobSearch-Applications`, running `scripts/run-fill.ps1`
against the reserved `_applications` prompt below). It covers every account in
a single CLI turn, pulling each one's outstanding rows and then fanning the
reading out to a subagent per posting.

**Almost none of this is visible on the tracker page, deliberately.** There is
no per-row "waiting", no button to press and nothing to answer while it works.
`applications.autofill` is bookkeeping - `''` (not read yet), `filled`,
`failed` - and its only job is that a posting is read **once**. What the page
does show is `autofill_note`, whenever there is one: on a `failed` row ("could
not read this posting") and on a partially-read `filled` row ("read part of
this posting"). Those are the rows with something still to do on them, and
nothing else would say so. Neither is retried; `POST /api/applications/requeue` below is an operator's tool, not a retry. Which rows a run gets is
derived from the rows themselves, not requested: a link, the flag still `''`,
and a blank company, role or location. So nothing is queued or flagged at
creation, an application made from a lead is never fetched (it has all three
already), and deploying this doesn't send a run at every application in the
database - only at the ones with a gap. See
`migrations/0009_application_autofill.sql`.

- `GET /api/applications/pending` -> `{ applications: [{id, link}] }` - what tonight's run should read. Two columns, for the same reason `/api/dedup/:key` is narrow: it lands in a headless run's context every night. The server decides what belongs here rather than the caller filtering - a run asked to judge which applications look unfinished is a run that can decide a filled-in one looks unfinished enough to overwrite. An empty list is the ordinary answer and means "stop", not "something is wrong".
- `POST /api/applications/autofill` - body `{ filled: [{id, company, title, location, team, setup, comp, note?}], failed: [{id, reason}] }` -> `{ filled, failed, unmatched: [id] }`. **A partial read is a `filled` row with a `note`, not a failure** - a board that renders its description client-side still ships the role and employer in its JSON-LD and `<title>`, and so does a closed listing that still names the role, so a run legitimately comes back with some fields and an explanation for the rest. The fields are real; the note says why the row is still short. `failed` is only for a posting that yielded nothing at all. One call for the whole night, the shape `/api/verified` and `/api/delist` take. **A fill only ever writes into a column that is still empty** - a day passes between a row being added and its posting being read, and the person's own typing must win over a machine's reading of a page. Only rows still flagged `''` move, so an id in `unmatched` means that row was deleted or already reported in between: ordinary, and nothing to retry. A `filled` entry carrying no usable field still marks the row read - refusing it would be tidier and would put that row back in every queue from then on. `failed` is final too (`autofill_note` holds the reason, which nothing displays): the failures that happen here - taken down, login wall, blocked domain - are the ones a retry doesn't fix, so a row that kept its place would be re-fetched every night forever without ever saying so. There is no route that re-queues a row, and that is the point.
- `POST /api/applications/requeue` - body `{ ids: [...] }` -> `{ requeued }` - clears the read flag on rows the caller names, so the next run reads their postings again. **Not a retry**: a row is read once by design, nothing on the page or on a schedule calls this, and it takes explicit ids rather than offering a "re-read everything that failed" switch that would invite being wired to one. It exists for the one case the design can't cover on its own - the reader itself got better, so rows that failed under the older instructions never really had a first read. That is a judgement about a change to the code, made by whoever made the change.
- `GET /api/prompt/_applications` -> **`text/plain`** - that nightly run's prompt (`src/prompt.js`'s `buildAutofillPrompt`). A reserved key under `/api/prompt`, not a track; underscore-first so it can't collide with a track key someone actually chose, and the route sits above the track pattern in `src/routes/index.js` for the same reason. **The only route here whose body doesn't depend on who asked** - one nightly task (`scripts/run-fill.ps1`, registered as `JobSearch-Applications`) covers every account on a machine, so the prompt is written for "each account you were given" and the runner supplies the accounts as `TRACKER_TOKEN_1..N`. That keeps this feature from needing a cross-user route at all: every request is still one person's token against their own rows. The run pulls all the queues, then fans the reading out to one subagent per posting - each given a URL and nothing else, no token or id - and makes the writes itself. **It records no run**, unlike every search: this fills in fields the person can always type themselves, on rows already in front of them, and a run record would be a status readout for something with no status. The evidence it stopped is a row that stayed blank, and the fix for that row is the same either way.
- `POST /api/delete-leads` - body `{ "ids": [...], "reason": "..." }` ->
  `{ removed, kept, unmatched, reason }`. Postings the person has decided
  against. Each lead is deleted and its URL written to `screened` with the
  reason given, which is what stops tomorrow's run rediscovering the URL and
  adding it straight back. `reason` is required: the screened row is the only
  lasting record of why the posting went, and `/api/delist`'s fixed "posting
  taken down" would file a screening nobody performed. A lead an application
  points at is kept and named in `kept`, the same rule delisting applies.
  Batched, because narrowing a search's locations can leave a few hundred leads
  that no longer qualify.

### The three ways a lead can be deleted

They differ in who is allowed to ask and how much they can take, and the
differences are deliberate:

| route | auth | scope | applications |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/delist` (and `delistedOn`) | session | one posting a run reports dead | kept, untouched |
| `POST /api/delete-leads` | session | ids the person names | kept, reported in `kept` |
| `POST /api/purge` | **ADMIN_TOKEN** | every row under one retired track | kept, `leadId` cleared |

Only `purge` needs the admin secret, and that is the point: it empties tables,
so it must not be reachable with the session token a nightly run keeps on disk.
The two session-authenticated routes are both id- or URL-scoped and both refuse
to strand an application, which is what makes it safe for a run - or a person -
to reach them.

One shared trap: `DELISTED_REASON` ("posting taken down") is the server's own
marker. `countRunActivity` splits a day's `screened` rows on that exact string
to tell a delisting from an ordinary rejection, so **every route that lets a
caller supply a reason must reserve it** - `handleAddScreened` rewrites it to
"dead on arrival", `handleDeleteLeads` to "removed by hand". The primitive
underneath (`deleteLeadAndScreen`) can't refuse the string itself, because
`delistLead` passes it legitimately. A new caller-reason path needs the same
guard.

### Config and prompts

- `GET /api/config` -> `{ tracks: [{key, label, full_description, sort_order, last_run, ...search config}], settings }` - this person's config: the track tabs, labels, display title, priority-location rules and staleness threshold the client renders from, plus the per-track search config and prose settings the prompt is composed from. Each track's `last_run` is its `search_runs` row (`{at, on, status, leads_added, screened_added, delisted, note}`; all-empty means never recorded).
- `POST /api/config` - body `{ tracks?, display_title?, overview_label?, applications_label?, stale_run_hours?, priority_locations?, excluded_companies?, geo_scope_line?, scope_clause?, scope_disqualifier?, location_guidance?, footer_note?, pronouns? }`. `tracks`, if present, **replaces this person's whole track list** (existing leads keep their `search` value even if its track is removed - they just lose their tab, they're never deleted) and keeps `search_runs` 1:1 with it. It never touches anyone else's tracks. Each track entry may carry its search config: `role_search_line`, `target_companies` (array, or a string when the list has prose structure), `search_note`, `resume_line`, `fit_clause`, `fit_disqualifier`, `fit_filter_step`, `leads_note`, `doc_file`, `doc_summary`, `doc_update_line`, `intro_note`, `report_line`, `screened_examples`, `schedule_time`, `fed_by`.
- `fed_by` (in the POST above) is how **one search fills more than one tab**. A track with `fed_by` set to a sibling's key has no search of its own: `setup-scheduler.ps1` registers no task for it, `GET /api/prompt` refuses to compose one (409, naming the track to run instead), and the feeding track's prompt turns multi-tab - its `./tracker dedup` covers every tab it fills, it files each finding under one of them (using each tab's `full_description` as the rule for what belongs there), and records a run against each (a tab with no run record of its own reads as stale forever). Use it when the split is by *level or kind of role* over an identical search - same companies, same resume, same scope; a genuinely different search should just be its own track. Refused if `fed_by` names anything but another track in the same posted list.
- `excluded_companies` (in the POST above) is a list of companies this person will not work for at all - plain names, or a catch-all phrase ("any other company X owns or leads"). The composed prompt renders it into a single never-search sentence, so adding an exclusion is an append to a list rather than a sentence hand-written into a track's prose - which is how the first two ended up in two different fields, discovered only by accident.
- `GET /api/dedup/:key` -> `{ leads: [{id, url, status}], screened: [url, ...] }` - the smallest thing a scheduled run needs to know what it has already found or ruled out, for one track. This exists because the runs were using `/api/data` for it, which returns every field of every row across every track: 398KB to use 22KB of, with screened rows accumulating ~150/day. That lands in the run's context every night and grows without bound, so the failure mode was a run eventually truncating its own dedup list and re-adding postings it had already screened. 404s on an unknown key rather than returning empty arrays - empty is exactly what a mistyped key would produce, and a run that believes it has seen nothing re-adds everything.
- `GET /api/coverage/:key` -> `{ companies: [{company, last_swept, board, note}], total, batch }` - **the companies this run should cover**, not the whole list: the least-recently-swept `COVERAGE_BATCH` of them (12), never-swept first. A company list long enough to be worth having is longer than one run can verify properly, and the failure isn't a company going uncovered for a day, it's every company being skimmed. The server picks rather than the prompt describing how to pick, because a cap a run is asked to respect is one it can talk itself out of on a night the list looks short. There is no privileged tier: a confirmed `board` makes a company cheap to cover, not exempt from the rotation. `?all=1` returns the whole table (seeding, and looking at it). 404s on an unknown key for the same reason `/api/dedup/:key` does - an empty list would read as "nothing to sweep" and the run would search nothing at all.
- `POST /api/coverage` - body `{ "search": "SWE", "on": "YYYY-MM-DD", "swept": [{company, board?, note?}] }` - stamps the companies a run attempted. Attempted, not found: a company whose board was blocked today still gets stamped, or the rotation retries it every run forever and the tail of the list starves. Creates rows for companies it hasn't seen, so one that broader discovery turned up joins the rotation by being swept once. `board` (`greenhouse`, `ashby`, `workday cxs`, ...) and `note` only overwrite when non-empty, so a date stamp never wipes an endpoint an earlier run confirmed. `on` is the caller's local date, same as `/api/runs`; an explicit `""` means "register these companies, I haven't swept them" - the seeding case, which creates rows without stamping and so leaves them sorting first.
- A track with any coverage rows gets two extra steps in its composed prompt (1c: fetch this run's companies and cover exactly those; 9d: record what you covered). That's gated on the rows existing rather than on a config flag - seeding the table is what turns rotation on for a search, and there's nothing to remember to set.
- `GET /api/prompt/:key` -> **`text/plain`** - the daily search prompt for that track, composed from the config above (see `src/prompt.js`). This is what `run-search.ps1` pipes into the CLI, and the fastest way to check what a search will actually do. 404s on a key this person doesn't have, and 409s on one with `fed_by` set (that tab is filled by a sibling's run - the error names it).
- `OPTIONS *` - CORS preflight for any route above - no auth, returns `204` + `CORS_HEADERS`. Every real response (including error responses) carries `CORS_HEADERS` too (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` - the session token, not the origin, is the access boundary, and it is never a cookie, so there's nothing here for a hostile origin to ride on).

### Config fields are mostly prose, on purpose

Most of the per-track config is the finished sentence the prompt uses, not a
keyword the worker expands into one. That's a decision the migration forced:
the hand-maintained prompt files these replaced had drifted from the template
that generated them, and the drift carried real weight - a resume line naming
a `.txt` fallback because the machine can't read `.docx`, a sentence widening
a company list beyond its apparent industry, worked examples of what counts
as out of scope. Reducing those to keywords and regenerating the sentences
lost them silently. Only the fields the app itself reads (`key`, `label`,
`sort_order`, `schedule_time`, `target_companies`, `fed_by`) are structured.

## Verifying a change

There's no CI and no test suite, but there is one property worth checking
before every deploy: **two people's data cannot reach each other.**
`verify-local.mjs` is over 170 checks, most of them exactly that - one user
trying to read and write another's leads, applications, tracks, runs, prompts
and application-fill queue by id, and getting a 404 or an empty result each
time - plus the auth behaviour around it (password reset, indistinguishable
login failures, per-token revocation).

```bash
cd server
wrangler d1 migrations apply job-search-tracker-db --local
echo ADMIN_TOKEN=local-admin-token-for-testing > .dev.vars
wrangler dev --local --port 8787          # in another terminal
node verify-local.mjs
```

Run it against a **local** database - it creates users and writes freely.
It expects one with no accounts yet; re-running against the same local
database is fine.

If you change anything in `db.js`, run this. A missing `AND user_id = ?`
fails nothing, breaks no page, and silently serves someone else's job search.

The migration gets its own check, because `verify-local.mjs` only ever sees a
database the migration built from empty - it would not notice `0002` losing a
column, dropping rows, or resetting AUTOINCREMENT on a database that already
had data. `verify-migration.mjs` seeds a throwaway in-process SQLite database
with pre-migration rows, applies both migration files, and checks what came
out the other side. No wrangler, no dev worker, nothing to clean up:

```bash
cd server
node verify-migration.mjs
```

`docs/schema.md` has a check of its own, which CI also runs on every push to
`main`. It applies every migration to an in-process SQLite database and
compares the result with the doc:

```bash
cd server
node verify-schema-doc.mjs
```

## Security notes

- **`/api/login` has no rate limiting.** A guessable password is brute-forcible
  over the internet in a way the old 32-byte shared token wasn't. PBKDF2 at
  100k iterations makes each attempt cost real worker CPU - which is also its
  own small denial-of-service surface - and the 12-character minimum is the
  rest of the defence. A per-name attempt throttle is a sensible follow-up.
- **Isolation is app-level, not privacy from the operator.** Whoever holds
  the Cloudflare account can read every user's rows directly in D1. This is
  for people who are fine with that; it is not a multi-tenant SaaS boundary.
- **Tokens never expire.** Revoke by deleting the `sessions` row (see
  [Accounts](#accounts)). Losing a laptop means revoking its session, not
  rotating one secret shared by every machine and person - which is what the
  old model would have required.
- **Every session token can reach every session route.** A browser sign-in and
  the long-lived credential a scheduled search keeps on disk are the same kind
  of thing to this API: `sessions.label` records which is which, but only
  `deleteOtherBrowserSessions` reads it, and no route enforces on it.

  That points the wrong way. The weakest credential holds the most authority -
  the `scheduled-search` token sits in plaintext in a `tracker.json` on a
  Windows box, never expires, and can today delete every lead, rewrite the
  search config or change what the tabs are called. A nightly run needs none of
  that; it posts findings and reads its own prompt.

  The fix is to split the routes the way the callers already are. Roughly:
  a machine-to-machine credential gets the run's endpoints (`/api/leads`,
  `/api/screened`, `/api/runs`, `/api/verified`, `/api/delist`, the coverage
  and dedup reads, the prompt reads, the application fill) and the document
  reads and writes it materializes from; a signed-in person gets the rest, and
  the destructive and configuring ones - `/api/config`, `/api/password`,
  `/api/delete-leads`, `/api/delete-application`, `/api/unscreen` - go to a
  human session only. Some of that boundary already exists as prose: `/api/unscreen`'s
  handler says it is deliberately in no prompt, which is a convention where it
  could be a rule.

  The shape to reach for is the one `./routes/index.js` already uses for
  public-vs-session: another list, not a flag per row, so membership cannot be
  got wrong by omission. Not built yet.
