/**
 * Job Search Tracker - API worker
 *
 * API-only Cloudflare Worker backed by D1 (SQLite). No dependency on any
 * particular AI tool - just HTTP + D1, so the headless search CLI can update it
 * with a plain `curl` call and the client can edit it with `fetch`. The client
 * (the tracker webpage) is a separate deployable - see ../../client/ - served
 * from its own origin (Cloudflare Pages) and talking to this worker
 * cross-origin, hence the CORS handling in ./http.js. Server and client are
 * versioned, deployed, and updated independently; see each one's own README for
 * its deploy flow.
 *
 * This file is the entry point and nothing else: the CORS preflight, resolving
 * who is calling, building the one `Db` instance their request's handlers
 * share, and dispatching to the table in ./routes/index.js. It has no knowledge
 * of any individual endpoint.
 *
 *   ./routes/           one module per resource; each endpoint's contract and
 *                       reasoning is documented on its own handler
 *   ./routes/index.js   the route table - path/method -> handler
 *   ./http.js           every Response in the worker, plus CORS headers
 *   ./validate.js       the checks more than one route makes
 *   ./db.js             all D1 access for a user's own data
 *   ./r2.js             all R2 access for their documents - resumes and the
 *                       per-track baseline docs the nightly run reads and edits
 *   ./auth.js           passwords, session tokens, who a token belongs to
 *   ./prompt.js         composes a track's daily search prompt
 *   ../migrations/      the schema
 *
 * Nothing here talks to `env.DB` directly, and neither does any route module -
 * it goes through `Db` (or, for the three routes with no session to scope one
 * from, a `Db` they construct themselves). `env.DOCS` is the same: only ./r2.js
 * touches the bucket.
 *
 * ---- Auth, in one place. Every route outside PUBLIC_ROUTES resolves its
 * bearer token to a person first, and the handlers are handed a `Db` already
 * scoped to them:
 *
 *     const user = await getSessionUser(env.DB, bearer(request));
 *     const db = new Db(env.DB, user.id);
 *     const docs = new Docs(env.DOCS, user.id);
 *
 * Those lines are the entire access-control story. No handler checks
 * ownership, because none can see anything to check: another user's lead id
 * doesn't resolve, their track key reads as unconfigured, their settings aren't
 * in the result set, and their document path names an object outside the only
 * key prefix this `Docs` can address. A route added later inherits this by
 * default rather than by remembering to.
