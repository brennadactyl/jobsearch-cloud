/**
 * How every response in this worker gets built, in one place.
 *
 * The route modules under ./routes/ never construct a `Response` themselves -
 * they return json(), text(), or one of the two canned refusals below. That is
 * what keeps CORS_HEADERS on every reply, including the error ones, which is
 * the case that actually breaks when each handler builds its own: a 404
 * without the header reaches the client as an opaque network failure with no
 * status to read.
 *
 * This worker is API-only (no page-serving) - the client is a separate
 * deployable (see ../../client/) that calls this API cross-origin, hence
 * CORS_HEADERS on every response. `*` rather than a specific origin: the
 * session token - not the origin - is the access boundary, and it is never a
 * cookie, so there is nothing here for a hostile origin to ride on the way a
 * cookie-authenticated API would have. Restricting the origin would add config
 * surface (one more per-deployment value to keep in sync with wherever the
 * client is hosted) without adding real security.
