/**
 * Who is calling, and are they allowed to. Everything that touches a password
 * or a session token lives here; the route modules and index.js only ever
 * call the four functions at the bottom.
 *
 * The model: a person has a name and a password (users), and holds zero or
 * more bearer tokens (sessions). Passwords are only ever seen by POST
 * /api/login and POST /api/users - every other request carries a token, which
 * is a random 32 bytes with no relationship to the password at all. That's
 * what lets the scheduled searches keep a long-lived credential on disk
 * without that credential being the human's password, and what makes "log this
 * browser out" a row delete instead of a password change.
 *
 * Replaces the old single API_TOKEN worker secret, which was one constant
 * shared by the webpage, every scheduled search, and anyone who had ever been
 * told it - unrevocable except by rotating it everywhere at once.
 *
 * No dependencies: PBKDF2 and getRandomValues are both native to Workers via
 * Web Crypto, so this file adds nothing to install or audit.
