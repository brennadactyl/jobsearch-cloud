/**
 * The one place that knows this is D1 (SQLite). Every `env.DB.prepare(...)`
 * call for a user's own data lives here - the route modules and index.js
 * never touch D1 directly for it, only Db's methods below. That's the point:
 * if this ever needs to run on a different database, only this file changes.
 * The rest of the codebase (request parsing, validation, deciding *when*
 * something happens) doesn't know or care what's storing the rows.
 *
 * ---- Every instance belongs to one user. `new Db(env.DB, userId)` binds the
 * repository to whoever is making the request, and every statement below
 * filters on `this.userId`. That is deliberately not a per-method parameter:
 * with a parameter, forgetting one argument at one call site silently returns
 * (or overwrites) another person's rows, and nothing about the code would look
 * wrong. Scoped at construction, there is no method left that *can* forget.
 *
 * A useful consequence: another user's row id simply doesn't resolve - getLead
 * returns null, updateLead reports zero changes - so the handlers' existing
 * "not found" paths become the cross-user access check for free, with no new
 * branch to keep correct.
 *
 * Users and sessions are the exception and live in auth.js instead, because
 * resolving *which* user is calling necessarily happens before there's a
 * user-scoped Db to ask.
 *
 * New to JS? A "class" here is just a bundle of related functions (the
 * methods below) that share some state - the D1 binding and the user id,
 * stored in the constructor. `new Db(env.DB, userId)` makes one instance;
 * every method call after that (`db.getLead(5)`) automatically has access to
 * both without you passing them around everywhere.
 *
 * ---- JSDoc typedefs: this project has no build step (see client/README.md),
 * so there's no TypeScript compiler. @typedef comments are the zero-build
 * substitute: plain comments that do nothing at runtime, but that VS Code
 * (and `tsc --checkJs`, if you ever want to run it) read to give you
 * autocomplete and type-checking on plain .js files. Think of them as the
 * "contract" for what shape an object has - documentation a tool can verify
 * for you, instead of documentation that quietly goes stale.

   *
   * Three counts, three different places they can be read from, and only one

   *
   *   - `leadsAdded` is leads filed under this key with `found` = this date.
   *     `found` rather than an insert timestamp because that is the column the
   *     table actually has, and it is the date the run itself supplies.
   *   - `delisted` is counted out of `screened`, not out of `leads`, and that
   *     is not a stylistic choice: 0004_drop_lead_delisted_on.sql removed
   *     leads.delistedOn, and removeDelistedLead now DELETEs the lead and
   *     writes a screened row in its place. By the time anything could count
   *     the delisting, the lead row is gone - the screened row carrying
   *     DELISTED_REASON is the only trace left.
   *   - `screenedAdded` is therefore everything else screened that day. The
   *     two live in the same table on the same date under the same key, so

  /**
   * Forget that a posting was ever screened, so it can be found again.
   *
   * The counterpart to a mistake. A screened row is a permanent instruction to
   * every future run to skip a url, and `dropKnownUrls` honours it for leads
   * too - so a lead wrongly delisted is not merely removed from the board, it
   * is removed from what any later run is able to rediscover. That is the
   * right default (it is what stops a rejected posting coming back nightly)
   * and it is exactly wrong when the row should never have existed.
   *
   * It happened, 2026-09-08: a run derived a "confirmed-dead signal" for one
   * ATS from a sample it had just built, found that the signal split that
   * sample cleanly, wrote it into the search's doc as reliable, and delisted
   * ten live postings on it. The strings it keyed on were boilerplate present
   * in every response from that host, dead or alive. Nothing in the API could
   * undo it: /api/delist is one-way by design, and the screened rows it wrote
   * made the same ten postings permanently invisible to rediscovery.
   *
   * So the row goes away entirely rather than being flagged. A "screened but
   * ignore that" state would need every reader to honour it, and the readers
   * are the thing being protected from a bad row in the first place. Removal
   * restores the status quo ante exactly: the next run rediscovers the posting
   * on its merits, and if it really is dead it gets screened again with a real
   * reason.
   *
   * Matched on canonical url (see ./url.js), not the stored string, because
   * the caller is working from a report or a webpage and the url that comes
   * back rarely carries the same tracking params it was stored with.
   *
   * Scoped to the whole feed group, not one key, and that is load-bearing
   * rather than tidy. The two writers disagree about which key a screened row
   * belongs to: handleAddScreened rewrites a fed tab's key to its feeder, so
   * a run's rejections all land under the feeder - but delistLead writes the
   * row under the *lead's* own search, and a lead lives in the tab it was
   * filed into. So a delisted Principal-tab lead leaves a row under the fed
   * key, which is exactly the row this route exists to remove. Resolving the
   * caller's key through `fed_by` and deleting from that one search reaches
   * the first kind and silently misses the second - found the hard way,
   * recovering 4 of 10 rows and wondering where the rest went.
   *
   * Matching the group is also what makes this agree with dropKnownUrls,
   * which reads screened rows across `groupKeys` when deciding what is
   * already known. A row it can see is a row this must be able to remove,
   * or the undo is only sometimes an undo.
