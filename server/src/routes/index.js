/**
 * The route table: which method and path map to which handler, in two lists
 * split by whether the caller is known yet.
 *
 * That split is the whole access-control story, and it is a list rather than a
 * flag on each row so it cannot be got wrong by omission. PUBLIC_ROUTES is
 * three entries long and every one of them is there for a stated reason;
 * anything not in it is in SESSION_ROUTES, where ../index.js has already
 * resolved the bearer token to a person and built the `Db` scoped to them. A
 * route added later inherits that by default rather than by remembering to.
 *
 * Every handler takes one context object (see ../index.js's Ctx) and returns a
 * Response, so adding an endpoint is one line here and one exported function in
 * the module beside this one.
 *
 * The API reference lives with each handler; ../../README.md has the prose
 * version. Persistence: ../db.js. Schema: ../../migrations/.
