/**
 * Verification matrix for the multi-user API. Run it against a LOCAL dev
 * worker only - it creates users and deletes nothing, but it writes freely
 * and assumes it can.
 *
 *   wrangler d1 migrations apply job-search-tracker-db --local
 *   echo ADMIN_TOKEN=local-admin-token-for-testing > .dev.vars
 *   wrangler dev --local --port 8787
 *   node verify-local.mjs
 *
 * Point it elsewhere with `node verify-local.mjs <base-url> <admin-token>`.
 *
 * What it's actually for: this repo has no test suite, and the one property
 * that most needs checking before a deploy is that two people's data cannot
 * reach each other. Most of the checks below are one user trying to read or
 * write another's rows by id and getting a 404 - the thing that would be
 * catastrophic and silent if the user scoping in db.js ever regressed.
 *
 * Re-running against the same local database is fine - it resets the
 * passwords it uses and tolerates its fixtures already existing.
