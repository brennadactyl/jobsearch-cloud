<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Fills in the applications that were logged as nothing but a URL - one run
  for every account on this machine.

.DESCRIPTION
  Generic runner - contains no personal data itself. It discovers every person
  under <DataDir> the same way setup-scheduler.ps1 does (a
  <DataDir>\<user-id>\tracker.json holding their tracker URL and token),
  fetches the fill prompt from the tracker (`GET /api/prompt/_applications`),
  and runs it non-interactively via `claude -p` in a single turn that covers
  all of them.

  That turn pulls every account's outstanding rows first and then fans the slow
  part out: one subagent per posting, in batches, reading pages in parallel.
  Subagents get a URL and nothing else - no token, no account, no row id - so
  every write stays in the main turn with the right account's credential (see
  ../server/src/prompt.js's buildAutofillPrompt).

  ---- Why one run and not one per person, unlike run-search.ps1.
  A search is a different job for each person: different companies, resume,
  scope, doc and schedule. This is the same job however many people there are -
  open a posting, write down what it says - and the queue is empty on most
  nights for most accounts. A task per account would mean N headless CLI
  startups a night, nearly all of them to discover there is nothing to do.

  ---- How it stays scoped to one account at a time anyway.
  The API has no cross-user route and this doesn't add one: every request is
  still made with one person's session token and answered from their rows
  alone (see ../server/src/db.js - a `Db` is bound to one user id at
  construction, so no query can forget to filter). What changes is only that
  one CLI turn makes those requests for several accounts in sequence.

  Tokens are passed as TRACKER_TOKEN_1..N environment variables and the prompt
  uses them by name, so the values are expanded by the shell inside curl and
  never enter the model's context or this log - the same handling run-search.ps1
  gives its single TRACKER_API_TOKEN.

  Every account must be on the same tracker deployment; an account pointing at
  a different URL is skipped and named, since one run has one TRACKER_URL.

  Logs to <DataDir>\logs\applications.log - the machine's log, not any one
  person's, because the run isn't any one person's either.

.PARAMETER DataDir
  Path to the private data folder (the "silo"), holding one folder per person.
  Defaults to the JOB_SEARCH_DATA_DIR environment variable, then to a "private"
  folder next to this repo.

.PARAMETER User
  Only fill this one user id's applications, instead of everyone's. For trying
  it by hand; the scheduled task passes no -User.

# This runs as a single headless, non-interactive `claude -p` turn - the same
# constraint run-search.ps1 documents at length, and for the same reason: this
# process exits as soon as the turn ends, so anything backgrounded is killed
# mid-flight and nothing gets written back.
#
# The line this one has to walk that run-search.ps1 doesn't: the prompt asks
# for subagents on purpose (one per posting, see buildAutofillPrompt's step 2),
# so "don't use subagents" would be the wrong instruction. What kills a headless
# run is not a subagent, it is *ending the turn while work is still outstanding*
# - so the rule below is about waiting for them, not about avoiding them.
$prompt = @"
IMPORTANT: this is one single non-interactive headless run. This process
exits as soon as your turn ends, and nobody reads any message after that -
there is no follow-up turn.

Subagents are expected here and the prompt below tells you when to use them.
What you must not do is end your turn with work still outstanding: wait for
every subagent you dispatch and use its result, and do not hand any part of
this off to a backgrounded Bash command or a background agent and finish early
saying you will report back. Anything still running when your turn ends is
killed with this process, and nothing it found gets written back.
