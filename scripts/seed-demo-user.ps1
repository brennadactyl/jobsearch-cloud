<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Creates (or refreshes) the tracker's demonstration account and fills it with
  fabricated job-search data.

.DESCRIPTION
  A third kind of account, alongside the real people this deployment serves: a
  demo one, whose entire contents are invented. It exists so the tracker can be
  shown to someone - a screen share, a screenshot, a README - without opening a
  real person's job search, which is a document about their employment, their
  rejections and their salary expectations.

  Everything it writes goes through the public HTTP API, the same routes a real
  search and the webpage use. Nothing here touches D1 directly, so a demo
  account cannot end up in a state the API itself could not have produced - and
  seeding it is a live test that those routes still work end to end.

  ---- What makes this account safe to show, and safe to keep.

  The data is invented rather than anonymised. Companies like "Northwind
  Systems" and "Kestrel Analytics" do not exist, and every posting URL sits
  under example.com, which IANA reserves for documentation and which can never
  resolve to a real job posting. So no row here can be read as a record of a
  real company's hiring, and no link can be followed to something it misdescribes.
  See demo-user.json, which holds all of it.

  It gets no `private\<user id>\` folder and no scheduled tasks, and that is the
  whole mechanism rather than an omission: setup-scheduler.ps1 discovers people
  by scanning for `<data dir>\*\tracker.json`, so an account with no folder is
  invisible to it and can never acquire a nightly run. The demo's data changes
  only when this script is re-run.

  Its tracks therefore carry no `schedule_time` - there is nothing to schedule -
  and `stale_run_hours` is set to a year, because the staleness warning reports
  a search that has stopped firing and this account has no search to stop. Left
  at the default 36, every tab would show a warning about a run that was never
  going to happen.

  ---- Re-running it. Safe, and the way to refresh the dates: the postings are
  stored as day offsets, so a re-seed moves the whole search forward to today.
  Leads and screened rows dedup on the server, config is an upsert,
  and run records are overwritten. Application rows are the exception - nothing
  dedups them - so a re-seed needs -Force, which deletes this account's existing
  applications before recreating them.

  -Force will not delete anything this script did not create. Before removing a
  single row it checks that every lead on the account is an example.com URL; one
  posting from a real job board and it refuses outright. That is what stands
  between a data file whose `user.name` has been edited to a real person's - or
  a deployment where "Demo" was later handed to one - and their application
  history.

.PARAMETER AdminToken
  The deployment's ADMIN_TOKEN worker secret - the operator credential that
  creates accounts (see server/README.md). Defaults to the TRACKER_ADMIN_TOKEN
  environment variable. This is not a login and not a session token; no search
  or browser ever holds it.

.PARAMETER TrackerUrl
  The API worker's base URL, e.g. https://job-search-tracker.<subdomain>.workers.dev.
  Defaults to the TRACKER_URL environment variable.

.PARAMETER Password
  The demo account's password, for signing in on the tracker page. Minimum 12
  characters (the API's rule). Omit it and one is generated and printed at the
  end; pass one to set something memorable you can hand out with the demo.

  Re-running with the same password changes no credential - the script signs in
  with it and provisions nothing. Re-running with a different one (which is what
  omitting it does, since a fresh password is generated each time) resets the
  account's password, the same as any account here.

.PARAMETER DataFile
  The fabricated data to load. Defaults to demo-user.json next to this script.

.PARAMETER Force
  Required to re-seed an account that already has data. Deletes this account's
  application rows before recreating them - see the safety check above.
