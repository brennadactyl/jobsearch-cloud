.SYNOPSIS
  Sets or resets a tracker account's password, interactively.

.DESCRIPTION
  POST /api/users with the deployment's ADMIN_TOKEN both creates an account and
  resets an existing one's password - nothing else in the system can hash a
  password. This wraps that call so the password is typed at a prompt instead
  of being passed as an argument: an argument lands in shell history, in a
  scrollback, and in the transcript of any agent that runs it, and the one
  thing this value must not do is persist anywhere.

  It updates password_hash only, so existing sessions survive - including the
  long-lived scheduled-search token in <data dir>/<user id>/tracker.json. A
  reset does not require knowing the old password, which means an account can
  be created with a random one nobody ever sees (see the job-search-setup
  skill, step 1) and given a real password here afterwards.

  ---- This is the reset path, not the change path.

  Someone who knows their current password and simply wants a different one
  does it themselves on the tracker page (click "Signed in as ..." in the
  header; POST /api/password). That needs no admin secret, no terminal and no repo, which
  is why it is the right route for the ordinary case - handing out a
  credential that can rewrite any account's password, to someone who only
  wanted to change their own, is not.

  What is left here is what that route cannot do by design: it requires the
  current password, so it is no help to an account whose password nobody
  knows. That is this script - a new account created with a random one, or a
  genuinely forgotten password.

.PARAMETER Name
  The account name, exactly as stored. users.name is UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE, so
  case does not matter but spelling does: a name that does not match an
  existing account creates a NEW empty one, and the person then signs in to an
  empty tracker while their data sits behind the original. The script says so
  loudly if that happens.
