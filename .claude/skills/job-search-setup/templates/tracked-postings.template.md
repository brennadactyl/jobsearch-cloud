# Tracked Job Postings — Daily Search Baseline ({{TRACK_TITLE}})

This doc is the running knowledge base for the daily "{{SEARCH_GOAL_SENTENCE}}" search - candidate profile, target companies, scope rules, and per-company fetch-reliability notes.{{SIBLING_DOCS_NOTE}}

**Posting data lives in the tracker DB, not this doc.** The "found" list (what's already tracked) and the "screened" list (what's been looked at and rejected) are both fetched from the tracker each run - see step 1b of the daily prompt (composed by the tracker - `GET /api/prompt/{{TRACK_KEY}}`). This doc holds only the knowledge that has no DB equivalent.

Each run should:
1. Fetch the tracker's current leads AND screened data (step 1b of the daily prompt: `./tracker dedup`, which writes `dedup.json` with `leads[]` and `screened[]`) to see what is already found or already ruled out (compare by URL).
2. Re-search the target companies below for {{ROLE_SEARCH_LINE}} matching the Candidate Profile below.
3. **Also run a broader discovery search beyond the fixed target list**: search generally for other companies currently hiring for these roles, plus targeted searches on companies with a strong fit not on the core list (see "Expanded net" below for ones tried so far; add more each run). Apply the same mandatory verification - a new company is not exempt.

   **This explicitly includes companies outside tech**: travel, insurance, hotels, food service, grocery and retail, healthcare systems, logistics, banking, utilities and manufacturing all run large engineering orgs, and they are the easiest thing to miss when the named list reads as big tech. Rotate through a couple of those verticals per run rather than all of them.

   **A company discovery turns up joins the rotation, or the run that found it is the last one that ever sees it.** When a new company yields a verified posting - tracked or screened, either counts as evidence it is worth watching - record it with the same `./tracker swept` call step 9d makes. The route creates a row for any company it is handed and appends it after the last position, so it gets swept on a later cycle without jumping the queue.

   Writing the name only into "Expanded net" below does *nothing* for future runs: the rotation is what the next run reads, and a company that exists only in this doc's prose is one no run will ever draw. This is not hypothetical - a track ran for eight days with this step in its doc, found nothing outside its seed list, and finished with an empty expanded net and a rotation still exactly the size it was seeded at. Keep the expanded-net list for *why* a company was tried and what came of it; the rotation decides *whether it is ever looked at again*.
4. **MANDATORY: fetch every candidate URL directly and confirm it renders an actual job description (title, responsibilities, etc.) before including it anywhere** - in the tracker or the summary to the user. A URL surfaced only by a search-engine snippet is a lead, not a finding, until opened and confirmed. Many "found" links turn out closed/expired/wrong even when freshly searched - check every single one, every run, including previously-tracked ones (they close later). Watch for search snippets that resolve to a listing/index page instead of the individual posting - that does not count as verified, even if the title text matches.
5. Identify postings that are genuinely new - URL not already in `leads[]` or `screened[]` from step 1 - and verified live. Match on the posting, not the string: the same job often turns up under a URL that differs by a `?gh_jid=` suffix, a slug, or a tracking param. The tracker collapses those itself on the way in, so a duplicate you miss is dropped rather than stored, and the response tells you how many it collapsed.
6. **Sync new verified postings to the tracker** via `./tracker leads leads.json` (step 9 of the daily prompt). The tracker DB is the durable source of truth for postings; this doc doesn't keep its own copy.
6b. **Record rejected candidates too.** For any URL checked this run that's genuinely new but does NOT qualify (dead-on-arrival, out of scope, wrong level, duplicate), record it with `./tracker screened screened.json`, each row carrying a one-line `reason` (step 9b of the daily prompt), instead of writing a doc bullet. That's what lets tomorrow's run skip re-verifying it.
7. **Update the live tracker** (a self-hosted Cloudflare Worker API + D1, see `../../server/README.md`, plus a separate Pages client - see `../../client/README.md`). Every call a run makes goes through the `./tracker` helper that `run-search.ps1` materializes into the run directory - it builds the request, stamps the track key and the local date, and reports what the tracker accepted. The daily prompt (`GET /api/prompt/{{TRACK_KEY}}`) names the command for each step; see that for the exact procedure.
8. If a previously-tracked lead is confirmed dead on a later check, **never delete or move it yourself** - report it and let the tracker decide. Report by URL, not by id, in one file listing every posting confirmed dead (`./tracker delist dead.json`; procedure is step 8 of the daily prompt), whatever `status` each lead is in. Report the ones you re-checked and found **still live** in the same step (`./tracker verified live.json`) - that is the only thing that writes a lead's "confirmed live" date, and it matters because a dead posting is now removed from the board rather than flagged, so a lead still showing is presumed live. Only report a posting dead when you actually confirmed it: a timeout, a blocked domain, a 403/429, truncated content or a JS shell that renders nothing all mean *unknown*, and an unknown belongs in neither list - leave the lead alone and note the tooling problem. The delist report cannot be undone.


## Fetch efficiency (apply on every run)

Don't re-spend a full verification attempt rediscovering a **domain-wide fetch block** that's already confirmed - that's different from a specific posting closing, which is real signal and always worth checking. The distinction: if *every* URL tried at a domain fails the *same way* regardless of which posting (robots.txt block, blanket 403/429, a JS-rendered shell with no static content ever, metadata-only, or systematic truncation), that's a tooling wall, not news. If specific postings turn out closed/404 while others at the same domain verify fine, that's normal churn - keep checking those in full.

Once a domain-wide block has shown up on 2+ separate run-dates (track it in the Reliability notes below as it happens), stop spending a fresh attempt confirming it: use a known working fallback if one exists (a different subdomain, an ATS mirror), or skip that domain for the run entirely if none exists, noting in the addendum that it was skipped on cadence grounds rather than re-tested. Re-attempt a skipped domain at most about once a week, or immediately if a specific new posting surfaces there via search that looks like a strong fit - a concrete new lead always earns one verification attempt even at an otherwise-blocked domain.

## Company coverage (apply on every run, once this search has a coverage list)

A company list long enough to be worth having is usually longer than one run
can verify properly, and covering all of it every night is what makes a run
shallow. If this search has been seeded with a coverage list, the daily prompt
carries extra steps for it - 1c picks which companies this run covers, 9d
records what was attempted, and 9e replaces the ones that turned out
unreadable. Follow them.

The rotation is a fixed list with a cursor, not a sort by date: a run gets the
next batch from where the last one stopped, and the cursor wraps, so every
company is reached once per cycle before any is reached twice. Recording a
sweep is what moves it. That means reading the list again mid-run hands you
companies further along rather than the ones you just did - which is what makes
step 9e work - and that a run which dies before recording re-reads its slice
rather than skipping it.

**That state lives in the tracker, not this doc** - same reason posting data
does. `./tracker companies` writes out the slice with each company's
last-attempted date and the cursor; `./tracker swept` stamps what a run
attempted and advances the cursor. Don't keep a parallel
table here: what belongs in this doc is which companies are worth searching
(Target Companies below) and what is known about fetching each one (Fetch
efficiency above). A confirmed board endpoint belongs in both - here as the
URL shape, and as `board` on the coverage row, so a run that draws that company
knows it can be had in one fetch.

## Scope rules (apply on every run)

{{GEO_SCOPE_PARAGRAPH}}

**Location strings drive priority - write them precisely.** The tracker classifies each row automatically from its `location` text (see `priority_locations` in the tracker's `/api/config` - this table must stay consistent with whatever was configured there); there is no priority field to set. Always include city and state (or region) where known, and use an explicit remote phrasing when a role is remote.

| Tier | Matches | Shown as |
|---|---|---|
{{LOCATION_TIER_ROWS}}
| Standard | any other{{SCOPE_ADJECTIVE}} location | no stripe |

Out-of-scope candidates get recorded via `./tracker screened` (step 6b above), not a list here.

## Candidate Profile (from {{RESUME_FILENAME}})
{{CANDIDATE_PROFILE_PARAGRAPH}}

Best-fit roles: {{BEST_FIT_SENTENCE}}

**Fit philosophy (apply when filtering):** it's fine - expected, even - for a posting to state a qualification not literally met on paper. Treat a stated requirement as a signal to weigh against the demonstrated background above, not an automatic bar: if there's a credible substitute case for what the role actually needs, it's a finding, not a screen-out. This applies as much to a *category of role* as to a specific requirement line - don't let "my resume doesn't document this" quietly become "exclude this whole role type," even if that exclusion started out written down somewhere as a caveat. A resume is written for a specific audience and routinely omits adjacent experience that would make a real stretch case; a gap on paper is not the same claim as a gap in ability. Reserve exclusion for an actual, verifiable mismatch - a skill, language, location, or level the posting requires and the candidate genuinely doesn't have - not a role category the resume happens not to emphasize. When in doubt, list it and let the person searching decide, rather than pre-filtering it out of view.
