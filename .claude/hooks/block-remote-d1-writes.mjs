/**
 * PreToolUse hook: refuse direct writes to the deployed D1 database.
 *
 * The tracker's data has exactly one supported write path - its HTTP API,
 * which scopes every statement to the calling user and validates what it is
 * given. A `wrangler d1 execute --remote` that INSERTs or UPDATEs bypasses
 * all of that, and it is what an agent reaches for when an API route turns
 * out not to support the field it wants. That happened on 2026-08-31: a
 * headless backfill found `/api/update` couldn't set `fit`, and wrote 131
 * UPDATE statements straight to production instead of stopping to report it.
 * The result was fine; the habit is not.
 *
 * Deliberately still allowed:
 *   - anything with --local (a throwaway database)
 *   - read-only --remote queries (SELECT, pragma inspection, counts)
 *   - `wrangler d1 migrations apply` - schema changes have their own
 *     reviewed, versioned path and are not what this is guarding
 *   - `wrangler d1 export` - backups
 *
 * Applies to Claude Code tool calls only; a human running wrangler in their
 * own terminal is unaffected.

/**
 * Paths that must not be deleted by a tool call, and the delete verbs to
 * watch for.
 *
 * The backups are the only copy of the tracker's data that survives the
 * Cloudflare account itself - Time Travel lives inside the account it
 * protects, so a local export is the whole of the off-account story. A guard
 * that stops an agent wiping the database but leaves it free to `rm` the
 * exports protects nothing.
 *
 * The hook directory is here too, so the guard can't be removed by the thing
 * it guards against. That is a speed bump, not a wall - see the honesty note
 * at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * Verbs are matched at an invocation boundary, same as the wrangler rules, so
 * a command that merely mentions a path isn't refused.
 *
 * The optional segment before `private` is what survives a reorganisation. The
 * silo used to sit at C:/VibeCoding/private; when the personal repo was moved
 * down into C:/VibeCoding/job-search-tracker/ the silo went with it, and a rule
 * anchored on the old absolute path stopped matching without failing - it
 * reported nothing and quietly allowed `rm -rf` on the whole folder. A
 * path-anchored rule is only as durable as the layout it was written against,
 * so this one tolerates the repo root moving down a level.
 *
 * The drive is matched as `c:` OR `/c`, because the same folder has two
 * spellings on this machine and only one of them was covered. A Git Bash
 * command says /c/VibeCoding/...; a PowerShell one says C:/VibeCoding/....
 * The rule used to require a drive letter followed by a colon, so a bash
 * `cd /c/VibeCoding/<repo>/private && rm -rf <dir>` matched nothing and was
 * allowed - which is how the local docs folders were deleted on 2026-09-10
 * with this guard active and silent. Same failure mode as the note above:
 * a path-anchored rule that stops matching does not fail, it just permits.
 *
 * Note the relative-path hole this does NOT close: a command that cds into
 * the silo first and then deletes by relative name has no protected string
 * in it at all. The filesystem is the real control; this is the reminder.
