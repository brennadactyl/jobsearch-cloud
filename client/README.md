# Job Search Tracker client (Cloudflare Workers, static assets)

The tracker webpage: a real, standalone HTML file
([`public/index.html`](public/index.html) - open it directly in a browser to
preview/edit it) with its CSS and client-side JS inline - no build step, no
framework, no bundler. It's a separate deployable from the API (see
[`../server/`](../server/)), served from its own origin and talking to the
API cross-origin over `fetch` with a Bearer token.

No personal data lives in this repo - the actual data (company names, URLs,
your notes) lives only in the server's D1 database. This client just renders
and edits whatever the API returns.

**Only `public/` is served.** `README.md`, `package.json`, and
`wrangler.toml` sit *outside* `public/` on purpose - a Workers static-assets
deploy publishes literally everything under its configured `directory` with
no exceptions, so anything that isn't meant to be a public file on the live
URL has to live outside that directory, not be filtered out of it.

## How it finds its API

One deployed client always talks to one server - the API URL is a
**deploy-time setting**, not something a visitor types in (there's no field
for it on the gate; the name and password are the runtime, per-visitor
values).

`public/index.html` reads it from `local-config.js` - **gitignored, never
committed**, same treatment as this repo's private job data (an API URL
isn't a secret the way a credential is, but it's still *your* deployment's
own detail, not something that belongs in the tracked template other
installers fork from). **Required, not optional:** without it, the gate shows
"This deployment has no API URL configured" instead of a way to sign in.

```bat
cd client\public
copy local-config.example.js local-config.js
```
Edit the copy, set `LOCAL_API_BASE` to your `../server/` deploy's URL, then
deploy (`wrangler deploy` from `client/` - it uploads whatever's on disk,
`local-config.js` included, regardless of it not being in git).

## Signing in

The gate asks for a **name and password**. It posts them once to
`/api/login`, which returns a session token; that token is what every later
request carries, and the password is never stored and never sent again. The
token lives in `localStorage` (`tracker_token`, alongside `tracker_name` for
prefilling the gate next time) - per-browser, never sent anywhere but to
`LOCAL_API_BASE` - so each device signs in once.

**"Signed in as ..."** (in the header) is a button: it opens the dialog that
changes your own password, without needing the operator or the admin secret. It asks for the current one as well - the
session alone is not enough, deliberately - and offers to sign out your other
browsers, which leaves this one and never touches the credential your
scheduled search holds. See
[`../server/README.md`](../server/README.md)'s "Changing your own password".

**Log out** (in the header) revokes that token on the server, not just
locally, and clears the view preferences with it, so the next person to sign
in on the same browser doesn't land on someone else's tab. It leaves that
person's other sessions alone - notably the long-lived one their scheduled
searches use, which keeps running.

Accounts are created by whoever operates the deployment; there's no sign-up
here. See [`../server/README.md`](../server/README.md)'s Accounts section.
One deployment can serve several people - each sees only their own tracks,
leads, applications, page title and location rules.

## One-time setup

Deploy [`../server/`](../server/) first - you'll need its Worker URL for
`local-config.js` below, and the client won't work without it.

### Quick deploy (recommended)

No Node.js or `wrangler` CLI required locally - the deploy happens in
Cloudflare's own environment.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/brennadactyl/JobSearchTracker/tree/main/client)

1. Click the button, sign in to Cloudflare, accept the defaults.
2. It forks this `client/` directory into a new repo in your own GitHub and
   deploys it as a Worker whose only content is the `public/` directory (via
   `[assets]` in `wrangler.toml` - no build command, it just serves the
   directory as-is).
3. Your client's URL is shown on the dashboard (something like
   `https://job-search-tracker-client.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`). Open
   it.
4. **Required:** in your forked repo, create `public/local-config.js`
   (copy `public/local-config.example.js`) with your own API worker's URL
   from [`../server/README.md`](../server/README.md)'s setup, then redeploy
   (`wrangler deploy` from `client/`, or push and let your fork's own CI
   redeploy it if you set that up) - see "How it finds its API" above. Skip
   this and the deployed page shows "This deployment has no API URL
   configured" instead of a sign-in screen.
5. Open the client and sign in with the name and password of the account you
   created in [`../server/README.md`](../server/README.md)'s setup - it's
   remembered in this browser for next time.
6. **Expect an empty page here.** A newly created database has no tracks,
   title or location rules of its own - the schema seeds nothing - so you'll
   see only the Overview and Applications tabs until the
   [job-search-setup](../.claude/skills/job-search-setup/) skill posts your
   config to `/api/config` (see the root [README](../README.md)'s setup step
   4). Track tabs appear as soon as it does, reading "No run recorded yet"
   until their first scheduled search reports in.

### Manual setup

```bat
cd client
wrangler login          REM if you haven't already
wrangler deploy
```
Prints your live URL, something like
`https://job-search-tracker-client.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`. Step 4 above
(`local-config.js`) is required for this path too - without it the page can't
find your API at all. Then sign in as in step 5, and expect the empty page of
step 6 until your config is posted.

## Updating after code changes

**Always deploy from `main`, never from a feature branch or worktree** -
merge/fast-forward `main` and push first, then deploy from a checkout that's
actually on `main`.

A worktree is the dangerous one, and it's worth knowing exactly why rather
than taking the rule on trust. `[assets]` publishes *exactly* what's in
`public/`, so a deploy replaces the live file list rather than merging into
it - anything up there that isn't on disk here comes down. Worktrees never
carry gitignored files, so a fresh one has no `local-config.js` at all, and
nothing about it looks wrong: `git status` is clean and the deploy reports
success while it quietly takes the API URL off the live site and leaves every
visitor at "This deployment has no API URL configured". This is not
hypothetical - it happened on 2026-09-08 and the sign-in page was down for a
few hours before anyone noticed.

```bat
cd client
npm run deploy
```

`npm run deploy`, not a bare `wrangler deploy`: it runs `predeploy-check.mjs`
first, which refuses the deploy when `local-config.js` is missing rather than
letting it succeed into an unusable site. A bare `wrangler deploy` still works
and is still fine from a checkout on `main` - it just has nothing watching it.

A client-only change (styling, a new field, a UI fix) never needs a server
redeploy. A change that depends on a new API field/route does need the
server deployed first - check [`../server/README.md`](../server/README.md)'s
API section for what the currently-deployed server actually supports before
relying on something new from it.

## Custom domain / different host

Nothing here is specific to Cloudflare's asset-hosting except the deploy
step - `public/index.html` is a plain static file. It'll work unmodified from
any static host (a different Workers/Pages project, S3 + CloudFront, GitHub
Pages, a folder on any web server) - the API's CORS response
(`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) allows any origin - just deploy
`public/index.html` there instead and skip `wrangler.toml`. One caveat: serve
it over HTTPS, not plain HTTP - browsers block an HTTPS API's `fetch` as
"mixed content" when called from a page loaded over plain HTTP.
